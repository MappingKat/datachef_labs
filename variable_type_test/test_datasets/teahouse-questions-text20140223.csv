There are several systems (APA style, MLA style, The Chicago Manual of Style, Bluebook, ALWD Citation Manual, ASA style, Harvard referencing, and Vancouver system, among others). 
For example: 
""APA style"": Cronbach, L. J., & Meehl, P. E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. Psychological
Bulletin, 52, 281-302. doi:10.1037/h0040957

""MLA style"": Lee J. CronbachPeter E Meehl. ""Construct validity in psychological tests"".  Psychological

Is there a uniform police for citations of scientific material?

I'm new to Wikipedia and am currently doing an assignment at University. We've been advised not to use primary references, but to instead use secondary references. For example, my group is making a page for Adam Joinson, we've searched high and low for information which can be found on his website but not anywhere else (e.g. early career). Is it a case of looking harder, or is there a point where we give up and reference his career from his own web site?

Lovecraft]]'s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft_bibliography#Fiction works of fiction] have links to the full-text story. I found a broken one earlier and am now checking them all. A great many are linked to Wikisource, using the template and that's awesome. Wikisource copies of the stories are high-quality.

But I've noticed that the links to Wikisource are all over the place. And sometimes it looks really awkward and out of the way. [[Nyarlathotep (Short Story)|Nyarlathotep]] is semi-awkward, [[The Cats of Ulthar]] is pretty bad, but I like the way it's higher in the story page in [[Azathoth (short story)|Azathoth]]. I think it might almost even work in the top section.

Would it be ok to move it or is that against general Wikipedia form? Right now it's so disjoined from story-to-story and the box really doesn't look as good with references or external links as a straight link to the story would. Thoughts? Precedent?

124,"483313141","HTML 5 and Visual Studios 11 (BETA) including VS 2010 - Read on ....","I thought I would bring this matter up with you that Wiki is not Visual Studios 11 (Beta) with HTML 5 (even though it works with Windows 7 and MS Office Professional 2010 Visual Studio 2005 and higher but not VS 2003 - and yes, it will work with MS Office 2007 Ultimate, not sure about the lower editions though) friendly; since I can split my Server (I do not run off of my Server - since it is a BETA to RC testing only so I can boot off from Win 7 or Win 8 mode from BIOS).

What happens in Win 8 - everything becomes distorted, Wiki becomes very vulnerable - I have posted concerns about this matter already; hopefully the Admins would take heed. I have been with Wiki since the beginning but never registered, as it wasn't back then required to register to edit; but I have done so to correct spellings or make addendum(s) if it was lacking sufficient information pertaining to that case study(ies) to the self same author(s) or University(ies) or in unision. Without going off the topic; it is difficult for me at this moment, due to my Main Server (FTP) which does not recognize the more advanced systematic I have insomuch having to shell out more money to obtain a Host that I find is absolutely asinine - especially when I am in a BETA - RC mode; I'd very much rather keep my security tight.

Now, with Win 7 mode - the usage of the HTML 5 (which is the enhanced mode insomuch FireFox, IE 9, and other Browsers are preferring it) is so simplified and can easily run off of a flash drive, such a dramatic change from the old days of numerous CSS mode just isn't working. I have attempted several differing modifications and variations; while it works just fine on other web design pages but not on Wiki. All the while yet, it is just a simple page (BETA) - if only I could make it hidden as not to allow others to see or view it until it is finely tuned; it would change Wikipedia and its own security as well to a higher level as well to the more advanced mode which means...

    *faster loading pages
    *quick search engine/find/topic
    *less drainage of resources (bandwidth)
    *the ability for those on enhanced mode such as HD/HDMI/Accelerators - to be able to use caret mode in Wiki       (something new)
    *dynamic enhanced graphics and images (even if one had an old OCR monitor)
    *increased traffic equals increase revenue/income for Wiki over Google for resources and researches making it more desirable for quick search and look-ups
    *the list is endless

This itself paints a whole new canvas and a whole new realm for Wiki as a whole in my humble opinion; more attractive than ever before, not putting the cart before the horse but the fact that reality has come and it is here; available now.

But after I was finished, I realized that with the ancestry.com membership that I currently have that I could look up the death records for the sailors that had washed ashore. So I did, and I found the records for the two men that are mentioned by name in my article. I also found the record of the body that had washed up in Port Elgin, but the coroner had identified him. And there was a fourth body that isn't mentioned in any of the sources. And there may be more.

So my question is, does this count as independent research?

I have been participating in a project on Wikimedia Commons, helping to categorize over 15,000 images of artwork donated by the [[Walters Art Museum]]. What is [[commons:Main_Page|Wikimedia Commons]]? Well, it's a website, like Wikipedia, but full of free images that you can do whatever you want with! Most of the images that you find in Wikipedia articles are linked to Commons, as editors can upload images they take and use them in Wikipedia. 

I love browsing Commons and also inserting images into Wikipedia articles that need them. What is a favorite image (or two!) that you have found on Commons? (Safe for work & all ages, of course.) All you have to do is visit [[commons:Main Page|Commons]] and type something in the search box and perhaps you'll stumble across something you like! Share a link to an image here! (And garner some Commons experience :) ) 

How can you share a link to Commons without using an external link (with all that http mumbo jumbo)? Just type [[:commons:filename]] and you can link us to the image without posting the image or linking to an external link!

But I assumed it just had not gone through so I started over.  So then there were TWO entries that were almost identical, except for capitalization.  So I discovered how critical it was to title a page with the capitalization that searchers would naturally use.  One administrator seemed happy with the first version and thanked me for the submission.  Another administrator decided the nearly identical second submission was not worthy -- though he did note the duplication as well.  He marked it for quick deletion.

2) In Word, my article had dozens of in-text references, all of which were marked by a superscript number and corresponding reference at the bottom. These references did not translate to MediaWiki and I am being told that my article has ""no in-text references."" What is the easiest way to turn my superscript letters into Wikipedia-worthy in-text references?

3) In addition to my in-text references, I have many other sources (clinical trials, etc.) that should be listed even though they don't correspond to a specific in-text reference. How and where do I include these?

The first time, the reviewer said that in-line references are required. Fair enough, and the references were put in place. The second reviewer felt that the ""submission reads more like an essay"" than an encyclopedia article. After re-working, on resubmission,  the article was again declined, now by a third reviewer, because the ""context"" may not be clear to a reader not familiar with the subject. I don't quite agree, because: the article is on a Malayalam (a vernacular language of Kerala, Soth India) litterateur and only someone familiar with and interested in the subject will look it up.
The article on the same person in Malayalam Wikipedia (not submitted by me) was accepted without hassles. Obviously, the reviewer must have been a Malayalee.
I think the issue is that an article in queue is tossed to just any reviewer available at that moment. Is it not possible to have the same person reviewing an article every time time?

There has been few occasions when people have been exposed to Pu without being exposed to other radioactive elements..The data is incomplete (remember the half life is 10000 years)and uncertain.Uncertainty is a fact in nuclear physics and should be included in a fact based encyclopedia.
Something like 2000 tonnes of Pu now exists in the world ..it is no longer a military secret ,indeed it seems to be moving into the economic sphere ,this being the case it is essential that the information  in wikipedia is comprehensive and when uncertainty exists it is reported.

I just wanted to say that I've been working on creating a new article, well really just a list. I could have posted it myself, but I wanted to get someone's approval first, so I went through that process, and I''m glad I did. It took a lot longer than it felt like it should, especially waiting patiently(???) for the assessments to come back. And the process wasn't perfect. But I really learned some useful things about sources, and citations, and such. Mostly I work on already created articles, and I've moved one from stub to C class, so I guess I'm getting the idea. But still, if I start another one from scratch, I'd go through the approval process again, to see what else I could learn.

For instance, one administrator suggested the Teahouse, which I hadn't heard of. Another sent me here -- [[Wikipedia:Introduction]]. 

So don't take the rejections personally, look at it as a long term learning process, and come here with all your questions. (I've asked a few really dumb ones.) :) But I've learned a LOT!

I wish to contribute a section of a page, but there is already some information there regarding the topic. How do I best integrate the new information I want to add? Should I just re-write the section using some of the information already presented, or cherry-pick my way through, adding a sentence here or there?

326,"489087401","New Box, since I don't think the old one can be replied to:","Hi, yes, sorry I haven't started writing it on the Wikipedia page, it's all in a notepad file on my harddrive right now, I should have linked it. It's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Penglai, specifically the section ""In Japanese Mythology."" I have a book (Waka Anthology Pt. 1, and a couple other books) which explicitly says a Japanese version of this mountain/paradise is Tokoyo. Now, I don't want to say that the person who put up all that information about Horai is wrong, because they may be right, but the entire section is uncited except for the mention of the book at the beginning. Anyway, I'm not sure if I should just replace the information with my info, since Tokoyo seems closer to the Chinese version than Horai, or if I should add my part at the beginning and keep the older info as well.

I have tried to get a new entry on Libertarian Paternalism accepted but twice got the editor comment that I should instead edit the exiting entry on Soft Paternalism to which ""Libertarian Paternalism"" now redirects. However, this entry does not properly describe libertarian paternalism and the two concepts are anyway quite distinct (though there is a minority use of Libertarian Paternalism that has some overlap with a minority use of Soft Paternalism so I can see how this happened).

As it happens, the entry on Soft Paternalism is misleading or incorrect. I have sort of mended that by describing the concept more correctly in a section in the entry on Paternalism. So it would actually be best if the Soft Paternalism entry was deleted, but if I could just have my entry on Libertarian Paternalism accepted that would at least provide a possibility for people to find some proper info on that concept.

Not that it matters but I am actually an internationally recognized scholar of these concepts so I feel rather confident about the substance of this, though not at all about the wikipedia culture, norms, rules etc. that seem to be getting in the way (maybe for good generic reasons).

Yes it is dirt that many probably don't want to hear. But it is well sourced and admitted by him. So the section was removed by an IP (anonymous) editor. The edit was hasty leaving an orphaned sentence still referring to the woman. It was the only edit activity from that IP and had no explanation. It was a big chunk (roughly -3300).  

So I went hunting for it by first taking large jumps back in history and then ping ponging to either side of the edit in smaller and smaller jumps to isolate it. Jump back 500 edits...see if still there. If not, reverse, but jump just 250..etc

Is that how you do it? Or are there better tools for isolating an edit (omission or addition)?

Similar question for talk. Is there a way to search an entire talk history of a page? Many pages seem have talk bundled into chunks or archives.  

Finally I was not BOLD. I'm super new. See my contributions. So I used the help desk to have it reversed by user DondeGroovily. I didn't want to bother Dondegroovily any further but my question would have been this. Should I have simply used ""undo"" on that edit? It was deep within the history and my gut told me that undoing something so deep in the history might just create more problems. What is the best way to do that? Is there a way to find out what Dondegroovily did? Did the user simply undo?

I have an interest in up-dating the Wikipedia article on composer/harpist Savourna Stevenson but have no experience in writing suitable text for Wikipedia. Perhaps you could give me some advice about listing suitable citations? I can see that an internet link can be created to a specific article published in a newspaper, but this can only be done for an article written relatively recently which is held on the newspaper's online archive ( ... for example, online archives for The Scotsman newspaper only extend back to 2004 ). If I have actual copies of older newspaper articles, which pre-date internet listing, how do I use these as citations? Is it relevant/possible to reproduce an entire article which is used as a citation, or is it considered sufficient simply to list a reference to the article/author/newspaper/date of publication? I am very interested to do some more homework on Wikipedia policies, guidelines and writing style before attempting more editing.

I was looking at the page  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range to find some info.

One problem with this page is that for different animals sometimes the hearing range is listed in Hz (Hertz) and sometimes kHz (kilo Hertz = 1,000 Hertz).  I am sure in the field that they swap backwards and forwards readily and it is so familiar that is not big deal.  However, for the non-specialist reader this is at the best confusing and at the worst makes the discussion of hearing ranges incomprehensible.

Should the the page be edited to standardize it?  Since this is not my field I was wondering whether Hz or KHz is better - or should the other term be listed in brackets.  Happy to edit it according to the consensus. Also the term Hertz has no link.

From an education point of view: An aside - I think for science (and many other classes of)topics there should be a non-scientist/specialist introduction to topics on those pages.  The Hertz page is a classic example of ""preaching to the choir"".  If you are conversant with physics the intro is a ""duh"".  For everybody else it is a ""WTF"".  I would suggest that all science pages, at least, have a ""lay"" overview.[[User:Jaairey|Jaairey]] ([[User talk:Jaairey|talk]]) 00:39, 20 May 2012 (UTC)"

objectivity

Also, is it appropriate for a company logo to be shown with the awards below the logo? -- It looks too much like advertising; company logos should show the brand identity and the awards are not an integral part of it (this is an opinion so please advise if I am being too harsh here).

Some ""achievements"" are more akin to PR.  Comments like the one cited below seem to lack a logical flow since an IPO that is oversubscribed and then collapses (contrary to market conditions) does not affect operations of a company.  As an example, regardless of Facebook's share price, the fundamental business is not affected by the vagaries of the stock market.  So to make comments like the one below (including a change in management -- which seems unrelated) seem to indicate the company's PR is learning the ropes on wiki:
<quote>2010 to Date
Due to the global recession and unstability in the economic and political scenario in the country, the FDI in Pakistan slowed down adversely affecting the company. In order to raise capital, Wateen Telecom decided to go public with an IPO which was oversubscribed. Unfortunately, right after the IPO there came a fall in the share prices and the stock index was declining. Realizing the situation, Wateen Telecom underwent a major transformation which also included a change in its management. <end quote>

We have external references to the club, internal wiki entries that mention us, notable Olympic swimmers listed, our British Championship results, TV show appearances but still we get rejected.

There currently is no synchronised club on wikipedia and only one page describing the sport which is dated - which is sad considering in the Olympics the sport is a sell out and will be performed in front of 17000 people. I am trying to bring this womens sport into wikipedia as it is sadly lacking with nothing regarding how it is run in the UK or the rest of the world where special schools have been created dedicated to the sport.

There was some writing already listed on the talk page so I scrolled down to the bottom and started from there. However, the first few sentences of my work are not showing up on the talk page after I save the page. Does anyone know why?

:Greetings, Palderoty, and welcome to the Teahouse! I'm moving your question to the top of the page so it will get noticed, I hope you don't mind. (Teahouse is the exception to the rule that at Wikipedia you add new material to the bottom of the page. That's because so many of us new people haven't figured that rule out yet -- but you have. Congrats.) If you click on ""Ask a question >>"" on the Teahouse page it will put your question in the right place for you automatically, next time. I'm new , too, and I can't really explain what's happening to you, but I can tell you that the best place to work on a new draft of an article -- or an entirely new article -- is your sandbox. The Talk page of an article is really just for discussing an article or leaving messages for others to see about the article. Give me a minute and I, or someone who knows more than me, will tell you how to start a sandbox for the article. [[User:Tlqk56|Tlqk56]] ([[User talk:Tlqk56|talk]]) 21:34, 9 June 2012 (UTC)"

I recently submitted a new article about a band from Austin, TX, called Wild Child.  The article was declined because ""the submission is not adequately supported by reliable sources.""  I've read the list of criteria on the ""Notability (music)"" page, and though this band hasn't won any major awards or placed on national radio charts yet, I believe that it still meets notability requirements, per criterion #1 (full text pasted down below).  Wild Child's album has been reviewed favorably by some of the biggest music outlets around, which seems to me to be enough to fit the bill here.

Here's the crux of my question: Was my submission declined because I'm mistaken about the notability requirements, or simply because I failed to quote enough neutral press clips?

The rejected submission is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Wild_Child

Thank you,

Has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, published works appearing in sources that are reliable and are independent from the musician or ensemble itself.[note 1]

    This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, online versions of print media, and television documentaries[note 2] except for the following:
        Any reprints of press releases, other publications where the musician or ensemble talks about themselves, and all advertising that mentions the musician or ensemble, including manufacturers' advertising.[note 3]
        Works comprising merely trivial coverage, such as articles that simply report performance dates, release information or track listings, or the publications of contact and booking details in directories.
        Articles in a school or university newspaper (or similar) would generally be considered trivial but should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Would it best, for instance, to start this as a subject on the wiki's talk page? Or, just dive in...? :) Or...? I'm asking in particular, because the wiki in question is in some ways, somewhat limited in terms of the portrait that emerges (I'm being very diplomatic, and trying to be sensitive here on racial issues.) I don't believe it was deliberate, but a lot of who he was racially, ethnically, culturally, and how that affected both his career, how he was sold, his music, his style...there's some of that, but not so much. I'm developing references to the cultural and political dimensions of his life as an artist and musician (some of which is in his own words). To further complicate matters, it's not completely clear to me from the current structure of the wiki, where I might place it. Under ""legacy"", new/changed subtitle to ""cultural and political legacy""? I really really hate segmenting off race as a separate part of a person's life - as a person of colour myself - because it can become a judgment and a limit. And in the case of this guitarist, it's so clear that he was all about a very different reality. But where to put this? Maybe it'll be two places.... Anyways, FYI, I did look back in the wiki history to the earliest listed editor - who from what I saw, doesn't appear to be the person who created the wiki, btw. Unfortunately, and I feel sad about this, he no longer contributes :( (His edits go back TEN years!!!! Amazing!) otherwise I would've very happily put a post on his talk page, to ask him what he thought. I know stuff like this can get very contentious, and you know, having been on wikipedia before for years, and left, and now coming back, I kinda like my uterus walls and other body parts just the way they are...and really don't want to be dealing with a nasty situation (I'm sure I hardly need to elaborate on that to the experienced editors who may read this....). Any suggestions about this? I just don't want to get into a major conflict with anyone... but, at the same time, yes, I'm convinced based on my research, that what I'm developing adds a whole new dimension to the wiki, totally referenced of course, and based in verifiable facts.

I have properly cited my edit and Yobol only told me once that he didnt think my edit was appropriate but gave no other reason for taking my edit down.  I sent him a message on talk, and asked him to stop taking my edit down without a better reason than his own personal opinion.  He continues to remove my edit without giving a reason. As a new user/editor I find this very frustrating, almost to the point where I'm going to delete my account.  I thought it would be fun to participate but it seems like there are people here who think they own the place.  Is there a way to get him to stop harrassing me? or should I just give up and quit editing?

702,"501315076","Proper format and content for a hard boiled novel (The Little Sister) page","I've been making minor edits to pages that describe books by one of my all time favorite authors Raymond Chandler. So far its been cleaning up minor errors and adding references. I feel ready to make bigger changes. I added a reference to the page for The Little Sister the other day. Its funny, I never really bothered to actually read the whole page until just now. I know the plot so well I didn't bother. Its terrible! The plot description stops about a third of the way into the book and then just ends with a story about how Bill Wilder inspired one of the minor characters in the book. I plan to make the plot description complete but I'm wondering what to do with the anecdote about Billy Wilder. I actually think it adds a lot to the article. I know a lot about Chandler but I didn't know that story until I read it here on Wikipedia (I got started editing by providing a proper refernce for that story). My question is, is there a good example page on another book that includes such a story? Something I could use as a template? It clearly doesn't belong in the Plot Summary. I think it needs to be in another section but I'm not sure what to call that secion? I think one of the interesting things about this book is that it reflects Chandler's (mostly very negative) experience as a Hollywood script writer and would like to create a section for further references to spport that.

704,"501422854","How to measure [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] of pseudoscience?","An editor has recently been adding citations to (I suspect) his own work in several diverse articles.  These have been reverted as [[WP:FRINGE]] without controversy in all but one article, where it may actually be appropriate.

[[Kirlian Photography]] is both a legitimate technique for capturing electrical coronal effects as well as a body of pseudoscience and paranormal healing claims that have grown up around the technique.  For example, a publication of I. Ignatov is cited in the article to the effect that the Kirlian technique ""provided evidence for the origin of life in hot mineral water"".  To the best of my knowledge, that text is accurate and neutral with regard to the content of the article.

Does this cite fail the [[WP:UNDUE]] clause?  

If this work was cited in an actual science article the fact that it was not peer-reviewed and the absence of follow-on work would be sufficient cause to remove it.  

While it could be cited as an example of pseudoscience, I would be more comfortable if there was a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] that stated the work was pseudoscience rather than just relying on my professional judgement.  I doubt any such published judgement will exist for work this obscure.

So, fellow Teahouse members, can a citation to pseudoscientific work in an article focused almost entirely on pseudoscience fail [[WP:UNDUE]]?  Is it appropriate to say ""Your paper must be cited by others to be mentioned, even if the citations are from other pseudoscientists""?  Or, in this case, does its utility as an example allow an exception to the Undue rule?

The comment was that it was ""poorly sourced"". Isn't it considered primary source material? It's documentary evidence of the following: Pete Townshend was the person selected to unveil the first blue plaque dedicated to the presence of Pop/Rock Star in the UK, and the plaque was for Jimi Hendrix - and here's what he said. I found no less than three YouTube videos confirming this. The other comment of the editor was that the additional info was too long for the wiki's intro - fair enough. But if I decide to develop an Awards section for Jimi, is this cat going to take it down again if I quote Pete on how Jimi was The Game Changer? I'm not making it up - Pete and several others have said it - on video. Just askin' and wondering. Because the big people who run wikipedia, may want to give some thought to how we're going to be sourcing articles once the destruction of journalism is virtually completed. I.E. we'll have to rely on video and other sources, much more than before (ailing papers can't afford to keep archive content posted without charging for it...or they just get rid of it altogether). Also, what does ""rm"" stand for on wikipedia? His entire comment was ""rm inappropriate to lead...."" Any thoughts anyone? Cheers,

1. I'm confused about the links at the end. Now there is an automatically generated list and a second list that I created that is incomplete. Should the second list be deleted? Any help cleaning this up would be much appreciated.
2. Kristine McKenna is cited as a reference in dozens of other articles. Is there an automatic way to make the name a link in those articles, or do I do it one at a time. How do I find those articles, since a search for the name now just turns up my article?

As I mentioned in a previous request here, I sort of got sucked into the vortex of editing articles, not because I was interested in their subject much, but because I though the coverage was wrong. Well I'm still in it.

Now though it has taken another bizarre twist. An editor who, in my opinion, has been rather forceful, and rather dismissive of Wikipedia protocol and policies in his desperation to enforce his will, has now resorted to making outrageous allegations about me in an article talk page to try to defend his behaviour. He has produced a crop of links back to disputes that he had way back in October 2011 (I didn't even join until early April 2012), and seems to be suggesting that I am either impersonating or actually am one of his earlier adversaries (he now refers to me as ""Ornaith aka xxx [someone else]"". He has been admonished by another contributor, but there are others involved who seem to sympathise with his actions. My question is this: is there anything that I could do, or should do, to get this sort of thing stopped. It is getting to be a tad, and I'm beginning to wonder if being involved in Wikipedia is really a good idea after all this upsetting intimidation.

The article was for a recurring guest character on a television show (and that particular character has had an enormous impact in the show's story lines for the last 3 years).  The person who deleted it did so by commenting only that the character did not deserve an article since it was not a main (i.e. regular) character on the show.  

While it is true that the character, Helena G. Wells, is not a main character - she is the more significant to the show than one of the main characters who is listed, and has shaped the overall show through her character's main storyline since Season 2.  As such I think it is relevant to include an article on her - especially since much of the information that exists for her is so pertinent to any understanding of the show itself.

My question are - when something like this occurs, what is the best method for resolution?   Is it normal to allow deletion of an entire article without discussion first?  Is it normal to not allow articles for television characters based on whether or not they are main characters?

I created [[Spaceflight radiation carcinogenesis and have been getting feedback that the writing is not encyclopedic and that it is a copy paste from another public domain document.  While a couple of paragraphs may be nearly verbatim, it is only because there is no better way to say it.  

Also, the topic is not exactly suited for recreational reading, so it may seem like it reads like an essay and is a little long-winded when it is just a very broad overview of the topic.

I felt beaten down right away. I found that administrators would undo my edits stating they violated policy (without addressing how in a helpful way). The most frustrating thing I found was that my edits would follow the format of a section which apparently contained other violating material, which I had been using as a guide for knowing if it was okay to add something or not. The other user would not edit the section to remove all offending material, but rather would just undo my contributions. I've tried to air my frustrations about this practice, but people just point me to ""other stuff exists."" I understand this in a broad sense, but within a one paragraph section, if someone is editing for offending material, I'd expect them to remove it all, rather than just undo someone's contribution. 

Also: why just undo someone's contribution when you could help dig up sources? I had thought that wikipedia was some sort of all-in-this-together thing, but after trying to contribute, it seems more like trying to present something to a strict boss and having her tear up your hard work and  instructing you to do it again.

before i was done tuning the site to look nice (formatting wikipedia page is a bit confusing to say the least) i got a notice that im supposed to change my username. i explained that i chose it because i work for coolermaster and didnt want to hide it.
i explained myself, and that i did this in my own free time, not for work.
but now after a couple of weeks all the changes i did to the coolermaster page have been deleted

1. im frustrated
2. i didnt get an explanation why it got removed and how i should proceed
3. is this just a matter of beaurocracy and if i create a new personal account and edit the coolermaster page again its fine, or will it be removed again?
4. where can i propose that this rule gets reviewed? on forums and in other communities company reps come forward and identify themselves as such, to avoid complaints about trying to manipulate puplic opinion. it seems on wikipedia company reps are forced into hiding and to PRETEND they are not biased. does anybody here honestly want to tell me the company pages of large international conglomerates are written by normal users only and unbiased?
i suggest that company reps get special accounts with some features that make those accounts more useful for them, and in return they are clearly identified and their changes are automatically marked as biased and can be reviewed more easily.

This question is not directly related to editing Wikipaedia - but i could find no other place to pose a wiki question.

I am in the process of creating an extensive enclycopaedic database for my young kids.
I plan on making many small flash cards - all categorized logically.

To get the ball rolling, i need to want to mimic the organizational structure of an encyclopaedia.
Since I'm a fan of WikiPaedia, i want to use it's content structure.
(though i won't obviously cover the entire content :-) - just a general portion).

I plan on using this page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Overviews) as a guide for planning my categories.
From this, i gather that the general format is

Portal -> Category -> Article
e.g.
Portal[Geography] -> Category[Cities] ->  Article[New York]

My question:
When i browse to any given article, how can i tell what the ""parent"" category/sub-category is?

e.g. For the ""Carpentry"" article for instance; how do i tie ""Carpentery"" to the parent ""portal"" classification ?

926,"507892117","How should I concretely understand that the article on Bacigalupo needs better formatting?","Hi, everybody.
I'm thankful to Sara for suggesting that I visit the Teahouse in order to get help.
I certainly accept the criticism of reviewers.
With regard to the article on Bacigalupo,I'm not sure what I should change.
I know I enjoy an informal tone - but I think I changed it to formal, as appropriate for a Wikipedia entry.Is it formal enough now? Concise enough?
I broke up long paragraphs, adding suitable headings. Is that part of the expected formatting?
I showed that the filmmaker Bacigalupo is notable. He is a noted experimental filmmaker. (The Turin film festival fairly recently had a retrospective of his work, and the Turin museum of modern art (the GAM) had a simultaneous exhibition showing documents related to his work. Major museums have copies of his films, and the new york filmmakers' coop distributes them or some of them. Jonas Mekas liked one of Bacigalupo's films a lot...) 
I also showed that his work as an Ezra Pound scholar is highly esteemed by other scholars.
Has this problem been handled adequately?
I omitted almost all online references, depending on serious printed sources. I think, however, that websites of important museums are serious sources, and so are city government websites naming the recipients of a prize awarded by the city. I backed up the websites of museums etc. with printed Italian newspaper articles that also appeared online (the way n.y.times articles also appear online). The printed sources form the bulk of sources. Are they adequate? Which are not, I ask myself.
I simply mention all this because I feel a bit helpless. What did I overlook? In what way did I depart from the paradigm that I should have respected? What would be necessary to have a properly formatted text? A small hint, tied to a concrete example (of where & how I 'erred') would be appreciated. Sorry, I make to many words, I know. Are my articles also way too long? 
O yes, I hope I'm not asking for too much help. I checked and read many Wikipedia pages on ""how to write"" an article. Learning, and glad to learn. Thank you for reading this.

His career has spanned 45 years or action and activities, including many praiseworthy successes in a wide number of fields. The dificulty is finding references. I sent the unreferenced article into Wiki (entitled ""Robert Sandford Stewart"") and received a curt rejection from DGG without any offer of help. DGG or David Goodman lambasted the article as ""puffery"" and ""promotion"". I pleaded that we needed reference material and asked for his help, not his condemnation and violant rejection. He proceded to thrash both Mr. Stewart and my efforts as frivolous. I asked five times if he would send just one example biography of a similar businessman, as he said ""he had written hundreds"". He refused to send one, after repeated efforts to seek a benchmark and how one goes about finding reference material. I am dealing with a man who exposed the discovery of AIDS to the world in 1980 and helped in funding solutions by setting up Global Funds Fighting AIDS with contributions over $50 billion. He also introduced the greatest single invention in modern telecommmunications (VoIP) onto global long distance telecoms. And yet, he works quietly, without fanfare and no public attention. David Goodman continues to trash him as someone not worth writing about for Wikipedia. I believe DGG may harbour serious academic preferences and violently dislikes businessmen, thus is being extremely unco-operative and very unhelpful. He is the quintisential academic librarian who lives in his bubble and doesn't recognize the contributions made by other non-academics who rise miles above his station, and without fanfare.

Now, I just left note on the editor's talk page that the info (from the ""current president"" section) was a copyvio from the university website and asked if it could be reworded. The info was re-added, slightly altered, but I don't think just shifting around the order of phrases clears the issue as it is not totally reworded or put into one's own words (or am I just too nitpicky?).

967,"508949685","About ""Administrators""","On Wikipedia, is it commonplace for one article to have a single ""administrator"" who judges every edit made to an article? The reason I ask is because I have tried to make edits to the article ""List of Transformers: Prime Episodes"", but I find that any edit or contribution I make, no matter how big or small, is taken away within hours by the same person: A user named AdamDeanHall. I have noticed that this same user takes away any edit or contribution that wasn't done by him, referring to himself as an administrator, but is this common, accepted behaviour on Wikipedia? 
I've never seen any other article come with it's own ""administrator"" before this one, and really I wouldn't mind as much if this particular user showed respect to others, but he doesn't. I've also noticed that this user has a tendency to be rude and disrespectful to other contributors (often SHOUTING IN ALL CAPS at anyone who does something he doesn't like, regardless as to whether it follows Wikipedia's guidelines or not, and reverting articles back to how they were without really explaining why). I've tried talking to him about how he speaks to other users, but have been ignored. So my question is are administrators for specific articles commonplace on Wikipedia, or is it just a control freak who's drunk on power?

She does the same thing on the Dutch Wiki, killing links to other language wikis.
This is the second time I come across Dutch ethnocentrism, I had put a link on a page that I had not created, and all was germane to the page except the language part, I asked why that link was not permitted and I was told that it was because it pointed to a non Dutch Wiki.  I decided to respect that person's rule as I had not created that page.
However now it is being done on the page I created.  I know it is probably not very Wiki to feel ownership of one's Wiki article, but I don't feel killing links within the Wikis is an improvement to any page.  

Suggestions?

I've been working on some articles on Administrative Regions in Guyana, like [[Barima-Waini]].

The Census actually has LOADS of information that would be helpful to Guyana articles (like populations of towns and villages etc) but I'm struggling with finding a way of citing it in a way that's helpful, because the only thing i can link to is the Bureau of Statistics website (as all the documents are PDFs and in some cases zip folders of PDFs).  And I'm also a bit concerned that these might ultimately move location.  

Another editor has really kindly been showing me how to use WebCite and i thought it would be great to use that with this, but I can't because I don't have an url for these docs.  Interestingly though, another editor had linked to one of the documents in the Census in the article on [[Regions in Guyana]] (I found this out only some time after I'd started!) using this address: http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter3_Population_Redistribution_Internal_Migration.pdf.

I'm back again with another question. I have noticed that many published articles on Wikipedia only have one reference, and sometimes it's the subject's own webpage. I was wondering how these articles have slipped through and were published anyway? I have also noticed that my article for creating a page for a literary magazine was rejected because the editor didn't like that I used a NewPages.com website, as well as a blog from this professional website (the blog was a 3rd party source as the owners did a write-up on the subject), but many of these other publications have used exactly Newpages.com for their references and were accepted. I feel like there is a lot of contradicting going on as far as notability goes. Here are some examples of bad references, no in-line citations, etc.:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glimmer_Train.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chattahoochee_Review
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_Weekly

My first attempt was through the Articles for Creation process a year ago, and finally got published when I attended wikimania in Washington DC this past July (and met some friendly teahouse types). 

I used the same process for a second article about a week ago, and haven't yet gotten a response, although I noticed that somehow the saint's name was mistaken in the AFC header--as her maiden name instead of her name in the calendar (and first paragraph of the semi-created article and included photo). Of course, I might've messed up even though I used a existing article as a template, but frankly I would just like to get the article posted (though she's on the calendar for March 26) -- so I can get started on un-wikified saint No. 3, whose feast day is Nov. 20. 

At the risk of violating wikipedia civility standards, I'll be frank and admit I have no idea on how to just post ""Harriet Monsell"" live as I saw mentioned somewhere in these bulletin board. Seems the AFC process is badly backlogged. Plus, when I used the process last year, the reviewers co-mments were more jobsworthy (to use a British colloquialism that's become my word-of-the-month even if somewhat rude) rather than helpful (I learned this summer that I had a space in the previous article's first line, which messed things up, even if the sandbox version looked fine). 03:23, 6 September 2012 (UTC)"

Hey MalibuSurfKing! No, writing one book and having it talked about on a blog doesn't mean the author is notable enough. There is an entire guideline for authors, and they are:
The author is very famous and/or considered a really important figure by scholars.
The author created a notable new genre, theory, technique of writing, or concept.
The author played a major role in creating a major work or has influenced a type of media (i.e. their book was made into a major movie).
Their work was a major best seller or is a legendary book, poem, poetry, etc.
I think that pretty clearly makes the call - no, she doesn't merit her own article :) Did this help? I hope so! You can read a bit more about the author notability guidelines here. SarahStierch (talk) 21:27, 6 September 2012 (UTC)

1044,"511216745","Translating an English article to another language","Greetings,

I would like to ask for clarification regarding the translation of Wikipedia articles from one language (English for example) to another (in my case, Greek). The focus will be mainly on expanding existing entries, and adding sub-entries from the original article as needed, until the translation is completed in a 1:1 scale.

While I am willing and able to complete a reliable translation of many articles, I am wondering whether I am allowed to use the same sources as linked in the original (English) article.

While the article will be Greek, the sources will be in English (unless I can add a translation somewhere, though I fear that would perhaps be too much work).

The reason I am asking is because there are many great articles (especially socio-political ones), and I respectfully doubt there are available source materials to use for references when expanding said articles.

I have come across an article which I believe seriously contravenes content guidelines. I offered a few examples on the article talk page after being challenged to do so. Other contributors there have defended the article content against some of my concerns, but not mentioned or attempted to defend it against others. The discussion isn't very productive as the other contributors seem to resent any contribution at all from me. Today I tried to improve the compliance of the article with one of the points I had made (one which hasn't been challenged or contradicted) but one of the other contributors reverted my edits and placed a warning on my talk page, claiming I was being disruptive.

The editors that have responded have done so in computerspeak with just a touch of academic superiority. I have tried to understand all the stuff I been told to read but it's not been helpful.
The editor that has tried the hardest to help is Ariconte but I've found no way of communicating with him/her. Ariconte's talk page seems not to have a way of asking questions.

1059,"511493473","Seem to be playing ""ping pong"" with another editor on the Robert Lustig page in the ""Controversy"" section","First, a bit about my background. I have a J.D. In law from the University of Georgia (1990)  and a Ph.D. in international trade law and economics from the University of Konstanz, Germany (1994). I have published in numerous peer reviewed international journals and as an international litigator worked with scientific experts extensively.

I am a new editor. This is my very first foray into Wikipedia editing, although I have been using Wikipedia as a reader for a very long time. In general I have been very impressed with Wikipedia as a source and have, by practice when using it, always referred to the source material in the footnotes in order to understand a subject better or double check the accuracy of an article. 

So far, I have been impressed with the accuracy of articles and the efficacy of source material; that is, until I read the Robert Lustig article, ""Controversy over fructose"" section.

The first sentence of this section stated, and now states again after my several attempts to correct it, that the ""majority of scientific evidence does not support"" Lustig's position, and the sentence ends with two cites as source material for this statement. I have read both articles and they do not support the statement made. In fact, the lead source supports Lustig's conclusions.

The final paragraph and source for the section does support the view that the majority opinion does not support Lustig's position, but the author, John S. White, of that source is a paid consultant to the beverage and High-Fructose industry. This source is not used above to back the statement made in the first sentence, but below at the end.

I have attempted twice only to add to that sentence White's affiliation with the beverage and fructose industry so that readers may be informed of his affiliation and can therefore draw their own conclusions as to the quality of his research.

Needless to say, this article is a hotspot for industry advocates who want to ensure that their interests are represented. Unfortunately, the quality of the article and its credibility is being negatively affected and its contents will continue to mislead readers as to the controversy over fructose unless certain edits are made.

The edits I have made deal only with the source material offered in the original article and are not a comment or evaluation of whether Lustig's position is ultimately correct or not. Simply put, the source material offered in this article so far either supports his position or, if it is against, is tainted by economic bias.

The reasons I have become interested in editing this particular article are two-fold: 1. I have discussed the issues with a biochemist friend at a cocktail party recently, and at her suggestion; 2. Watched Prof. Lustig's extensive lecture on YouTube.  After the lecture I visited the Wikipedia page in order to get to possible sources and scientific articles on the subject. I discovered the problematic nature of the articles assertions upon reading the source material cited as described above.

I would like the article to reflect the source material accurately and any bias in the sources to be transparent to readers.

Kind regards,

Thomas J. Dillon, Jr.

May I humbly inquire,

Are source origination; Title and copyright details alone, considered fair and reasonable accreditation, when there's no on-line ability to verify a source, based on written, published text, that best personifies the defining attributes of encyclopedic worthiness?  


The code of ethics in journalism, by virtue, dictate Sidestepping this, by means of ''selective aversion-reference denotation,'' as moderately deceptive at best and in potential, unilaterally diminishes the heart of ethics in journalism.

Polydi is a new dice shape invented in 2012.  The die has two semi round sections (top and bottom) and triangular sections around the body of the die.  The triangular sections allow for the random roll.  When the die is rolled or spun, it will come to rest on one of the triangle sides.  The Polydi design was submitted to the patent office in 2012.

: YouTube links are rarely acceptable, but occasionally are. One of the problems is that they often violate copyright, which we do not permit. Another issue, a big one, is that most people upload material to YouTube using the standard YouTube license, which is incompatible with Wikipedia. If the material does not have copyright problems, the licensing issues can be address, if the author is willing, although it is only fair to note that I haven't covered all the issues. YouTube video rarely qualify as reliable sources, so we would have to review that as well.

:<blockquote>
::''It is highly recommended that every NRHP article use the official NRHP Inventory/Nomination document as a source about the listing. They often include primary research information including description of the condition of a property at the time the document was written and secondary research information about the historical importance of the place. They are provided by the Federal government but are often written by state or local government staff or by private consultants or other parties who have not transferred copyright. As such, they are generally '''not in the public domain''', even though most U.S. Federal government works are.''

::Hmm, well thanks for the vote of personal confidence i guess. :) Sphilbrick is doing fine with what he's said already.  Yes, the NRHP nomination documents are generally very interesting and it seems helpful to link them into Wikipedia articles on the individual places, as I happened to do for [[Methodist Episcopal Church of Montrose|this Colorado NRHP article]] today.  The National Park Service is only part way through making them available online in linkable form through their search system [http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natreghome.do here].  You can search for the Brow Monument one there, but find your way only to a discouraging ""Not yet digitized"" PDF file, ironic since you happen to know they have that one digitized.  But they will get around to making them all available for Arizona sometime soon I hope.  Colorado and California ones were recently all made available;  Utah and a bunch of other states have been available for a while.  For now, the best thing you can do is use the document you have to add information to the article, and cite from it as if it is an entirely offline source.  Eventually a url to the document can be added.

Since you only have three threads on your page, Miszabot leaves it alone.  If you had two more threads on your talk page (which would total to five), then Miszabot would archive the one oldest thread, bringing it back down to four.  Does that makes sense?

A while ago, I reverted an edit on the Stephen Leather page; at the time I did say it was because I thought it was vandalism. There was then much too-ing & fro-ing and re-wording of the piece in question done by others, then a complete re-vamp was done on the page.
I had tried to avoid discussion with the person who made the original amendment as alterations seemed to be being made by other editors. I did still keep a watch on the page as it has been subjected to adverse alterations in the past.
A sock puppet investigation was then instigated about the person who had made the amendment and I discovered I was also listed on it.
Unfortunately, the other evening I did respond - maybe I regret it a bit now - so then felt it was probably better just to walk away and leave it all well alone again.
However, today when I was checking to see if anything further had been done about the 'sock puppet' allegations, I happened to go onto the users Talk page and discovered what (I feel) is quite a lengthy diatribe against me. I have never posted on his talk page, so he must have copied/pasted I comment I made elsewhere.
I'm not sure what to do now?

I am a new user (registered about two hours ago) and am only looking to update charity page of the organisation I work for. Looking at other charity logos used on the site, I can state that the following is correct for the logo in question.

Description: Charity logo
Source: May be obtained from Christian Aid.
Article: Charity
Portion used: The entire logo is used to convey the meaning intended and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the intended image.
Low resolution?	The logo is of a size and resolution sufficient to maintain the quality intended by the company or organization, without being unnecessarily high resolution.
Purpose of use: The image is used to identify the charity, a subject of public interest. The significance of the logo is to help the reader identify the organization, assure the readers that they have reached the right article containing critical commentary about the organization, and illustrate the organization's intended branding message in a way that words alone could not convey.
Replaceable? Because it is a logo there is almost certainly no free equivalent. Any substitute that is not a derivative work would fail to convey the meaning intended, would tarnish or misrepresent its image, or would fail its purpose of identification or commentary.
Other information: Use of the logo in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy, logo guidelines, and fair use under United States copyright law as described above.

Can I send my logo somewhere for it to be uploaded for me? Do I need to wait until I am auto-confirmed and then I can add it? What I don't want to do is add it as Creative Commons.

1121,"513610944","What are the guidelines for adding information to existing articles?","Hello,
So far I've only done one short article and made a few minor corrections to existing articles. What I'm not sure about is adding new information or detail to existing articles.  How do people decide if the new info makes the article more useful or interesting, and who has the final word? How much information is too much? Is there a sort of rough consensus about which topics are worthy of long articles - for example, you'd obviously expect to find a lot of information on Charles Dickens (for the sake of argument), but how much is too much for some lesser contemporary - given that there is always someone out there who is an expert on obscure topics? 

Also what about adding details which then link to other Wikipedia articles - for example, in an article about a city, if I happen to know that a famous/notable person was born there and this is not mentioned, would it be appropriate to add a paragraph or so and link it?  At what point does the mass of detail begin to detract from the clarity of an article for the general reader? Another example would be a biographical article - suppose I've read a biography which would add a lot to a short wiki bio - can I add this info, referencing the biography? Should I reference the biographer's sources as well? What if the subject or the new info is disputed or controversial? Is it better to put all suggestions for changes on the 'talk' part of the page?

Rather a lot of questions, sorry, but they are all related I think. Thanks [[User:TuttiFruttiCherryPie|TuttiFruttiCherryPie]] ([[User talk:TuttiFruttiCherryPie|talk]]) 23:36, 19 September 2012 (UTC)"

I looked into it further and found out that any perspectives on SRA other than that it was a moral panic based on false memories, are censored from wikipedia. 
My understanding is that wikipedia is not supposed to censor information, but that as an encyclopedia it is supposed to stay neutral and present all facts and perspectives without adopting language that takes one side of the controversy. If this is true, why are some subjects being censored to present only one perspective?

I came through the Teahouse a few weeks ago when I was working on my first article - for the person Leila Gurruwiwi. At that time I had included 3 separate newspaper profiles of her, which seemed to me to satisfy the notability requirement of ""multiple published secondary sources which are reliable, intellectually independent of each other, and independent of the subject,"" and a host here confirmed that it looked good. I submitted it to Articles for Creation, but it just got rejected for lack of notability. I've just added several more sources, and I was wondering if someone could take another look at it and tell me if I've fixed the problem? It is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Leila_Gurruwiwi

The other thing is, I want to link to an article in The City Weekly, but the article is not currently available on the newspaper's own website. So I've linked in the article to a copy of the article which is available at this website: http://kathrynkernohan.com/2012/09/27/life-goals/ Is this acceptable?

First thing this morning I noticed that an IP had changed the Spaniel article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniel) so throughout the article 'Spaniel' read as 'Spaniard'. I reverted this.
Someone has now undone my reversion.
Maybe I'm reading this totally wrongly but I don't want to revert it again.
Would it be possible for someone here to have a look at it to make sure I'm not just having a completely senile moment?

1278,"518870231","How to deal with an editor who may be overly biased","Hi, since I am still relatively a novice in wikipedia I am asking the question here. On the main wikipage that I have been editing there is one editor who has consistently deleted sourced information and used edit reversions to get rid of sourced information. The article in question is about a church, a religious organization, and most of these things take place in its ""controversy"" section where accusations against the church are dealt with. At first each edit that I have made their to add multiple points of view, delete unsourced information, and remove implications not supported explicitly by the sources have been met with deletions and edit revisions.

Some of them included an erroneous accusation of misrepresenting sources even though the information they removed was inside the sources themselves. Attempts to change subsection titles to confirm with wiki policy have been met with resistance. At times I feel that the editor is trying to keep a certain image of the subsection preserved, mostly one that sheds an overly negative image of the church. 

On our talk pages and the article's talk page he has expressed the belief that these accusations are factual beyond a shadow of a doubt. Now that is okay, it is the editor's opinion, but it is this belief that I feel is causing troublesome edit reversions. All his edits seem to only shed negative light on the church and has made blanket accusations of plagerism against me. A close paraphrasing tag was removed by another editor and he reinserted it. He also badly translated (rather mistranslated) a quote from an Spanish paper and reverted my deletion since it was misquoted and out of place which made the church appear bad.

What should I do about the user? This has been happening over long time now. How do I know my feelings are well founded or just a knee jerk reaction?

I'm confused about the reasons for my submission being rejected.  I was careful to write from a neutral point of view and refer to a wide range of published reputable sources.  In addition, because my subject, Jon Cohen (entrepreneur) is  partners with Rob Stone (entrepreneur), who has had a Wiki page for years, they share a lot of the same background and references. I tried to play it safe by lifting some of the exact wording since they work as partners.
So I'm wondering why what was approved for Rob Stone was not acceptable for Jon Cohen. Any specifics that were particularly objectionable to too ""self-serving"" that  you could point me to would be much appreciated.

""This submission appears to read more like an advertisement than an entry in an encyclopedia. Encyclopedia articles need to be written from a neutral point of view, and should refer to a range of independent, reliable, published sources, not just to materials produced by the creator of the subject being discussed. This is important so that the article can meet Wikipedia's verifiability policy and the notability of the subject can be established. If you still feel that this subject is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, please rewrite your submission to comply with these policies.""

1401,"521741917","Layout overhaul","Hello.

Has there ever been any consideration for some sort of project involving the rearrangement of articles into a uniform structure? That is subject permitted, of course; for example, pages encompassed by a general topic, such as classical liberalism and modern liberalism to political ideologies, would have a specific layout of content. 

As it stands, classical liberalism contains the following structure of contents:

1 Core principles
2 History
3 Intellectual sources
3.1 John Locke
3.2 Adam Smith
3.3 Say, Malthus and Ricardo
3.4 Utilitarianism
4 Political economy
5 Free trade and world peace
6 Relationship to modern liberalism
7 See also
8 Notes
9 References

However, modern social liberalism contains the following layout of contents:

1 Origins
1.1 United Kingdom
1.2 Germany
1.3 France
1.4 United States
2 Implementation
2.1 United Kingdom
2.2 Rest of Europe
2.3 United States
3 Reversal
4 Active social liberal parties and organizations
5 Historical social liberal parties and organizations
6 Notable social liberal thinkers
7 See also
8 Notes
9 References
10 Further reading

Would I be within my rights, provided that all information (unless found incorrect or irrelevant) remains within the article, to restructure the articles, and, of course, others, to a peer assessed template that would allow a consistent layout of information for readers? This would imply I have the time to meticulously recreate a convoluted encyclopaedic article; hypothetically, though, just so I know for future reference!

The name of the school has changed and I am trying to reflect this name change in the article.  I have read through the documentation that suggests that having the page deleted and starting a new article is not the way to go.  

It suggested that I include the topic on the talk page to have the article redirected. It has been up for a while now and no one seems to have anything to say about it.  How do I proceed to having the article with the old name redirected to an article with the new name and have all of the content moved with it?

The study (more like a survey) seems well-thought out and legitimate but the website itself says at the bottom that it is an affiliate website that pays for reviews. 

Here is the edit:

""In an online survey from November 2009 among 303 smokers, it was found that e-cigarette substitution for tobacco cigarettes resulted in reduced perceived health problems, when compared to smoking conventional cigarettes (less cough, improved ability to exercise, improved sense of taste and smell).[46] Another online survey from October 2012 among e-cigarette owners confirms such findings. About 90% of participants that are using an e-cigarette feel better and 92% have the support of their friends and family.[47]""

I have been a member of Eckanakr for 37 years and am a member of the ECK Clergy.  I need help with two things - organization and removal of vandalism.  

Reorganization: The page has some outdated information and is somewhat disorganized.  I tried reorganizing the page, but apparently ran afoul of some rules regarding inline links and so my changes were undone. I would like to reinstate my previous changes, but do not want to start some sort of editing war.

Vandalism: Eckankar is a relatively new religion and has some detractors.  The page has sections for Criticism and Related Groups.  I am of the opinion that criticisms belong under the Criticism section and discussion of other religious groups belong under the Related Groups section.  There is an individual who calls himself Akantha who is trying to start his own new religious group who has insisted on vandalizing the Eckankar page with his own critical comments, phrased as if he is an independent expert, but without citations.  I have moved his comments to the Criticism section, but he has repeatedly undone my changes and has done so anonymously - showing only an IP address.  

How can I make the organizational changes I want to make and also ensure that the vandalism stops?

This editor later created a ""hate group"" against the Living bio subject and has actively tried to defame her. The problem is that this editor controls the Wikipedia article of this Living Bio. We can prove that this editor worked for the Living bio individual, prove that they created a hate group, prove that valuable information from credible sources are being rejected. For example, we have a letter from the State of Oregon, with the Oregon state seal and the government official's signature and contact info on the letter that contains valuable information for the Wikipedia Living bio. However this editor is accusing us of forging this document and will not allow the information on Wikipedia. Other documented and direct testimonial from the Living bio ""person"" is repressed, such as updated information about recent accomplishments.  But we can't get access to the article to begin edits and every attempt is shot-down for unrealistic reasons. I am new to Wikipedia and trying to learn as fast as I can, but need some guidance as to where I can go for help, provide evidence to support my case and gain the ability to make edits to on this living bio.

:Hi Moocow6and1. Welcome to the tea house. There should be an inline citation at the end of each section of text to which that reference applies. That might be one sentence or a whole paragraph. You do not need to repeat the whole reference each time. A short version can be made by giving the reference a name as explained below (edit clash). The short version will look like <nowiki><ref name=(whatever the ref name is)/></nowiki> Note the added slash at the end.--[[User:Charlesdrakew|Charles]] ([[User talk:Charlesdrakew|talk]]) 19:51, 25 November 2012 (UTC)

:{{ec}} Welcome to the Teahouse, Moocow! The best way to cite a reference in multiple places is to include a name in the <nowiki>""<ref name=>"" </nowiki>parameter of the cite template and then to simply type <nowiki>""<ref name=(whatever the ref name is)></ref>"" </nowiki>where ever you want to cite the reference. Thanks and feel free to drop by should you have further questions.

I accidentally reverted an edit by an IP user on the Wonder Woman article and wrongly identified it as vandalism.

I noticed some text in red written in front of the ip user edit title- ""[rollback (VANDAL)]"". As this was the first time I saw some text like this, out of curiosity i clicked on it and it reverted the entire edit by the IP user and even identified it as vandalism. Well I wanted to revert the edit made by the user but not identify it as vandalism as it really wasn't! It's not even letting me revert by actions, saying it has to be done manually- which I don't exactly want to do as I was going to revert the edit anyway.

After reading the article itself, I noticed that there is no discussion of how people join the movement (i.e., do activists join because of ideological beliefs, are they recruited by members of their social network, etc.).

1624,"527699743","Who to ask to create a widget","Hi, I often find myself looking at a table in Wikipedia (or elsewhere) and thinking to myself: ""I'd like to download that data into Excel and rearrange it or merge it with data from elsewhere. But if I just copy the table and paste it, I usually get a long string of information. Instead of tabs between fields and a carriage return at the end of the line, there are just spaces between each of the entries. Using tools like BBedit, Tex-Edit Plus, Word, and lots of perseverance, I can usually recreate the table in a form that I can upload to Excel from this data stream, but it is often a difficult process (especially if the cells of the table have textual data with spaces).

So I would really like someone to create a widget that would make this task easy. What I envision: at the top of each table in Wikipedia there would be an icon. If you clicked on the icon, it would automatically download the table in .csv (comma-separated values) format which could then be easily imported into Excel or another spreadsheet program. I assume it would be relatively easy to create such a widget since tables have a regular and simple markup language (though text that extends over two or more cells might be a bit tricky). There are already widgets for converting spreadsheets into Wiki's markup language, but as far as I can tell, no way to go the other direction.

I was going to suggest this idea of writing a widget and making it available at the top of every Wikipedia table to someone at Wikipedia, but I don't know who or how to do this.

I wanted to ask your advice on what I should do to make sure it was an appropriate article, and how best to approach any COI problems? I think that on a notability point, there's good grounds for it to be a valid page, as there are pages for many other parts of Cabinet Office (such as the Office of Government Commerce and the Government Procurement Service) - and ERG is large part of the department (a parent organisation to GPS).

As per my understanding, updation of medical information should not be limited to tertiary sources. Primary or secondary sources should be allowed to use as and when required. For example, what if the information to be updated has no tertiary source? What if there are no systematic reviews available for updating the required information? Tertiary sources are drafted using primary or secondary sources. Without primary source there is no tertiary source. There are many topics in medical field wherein there are no systematic reviews available, and ""medicine"" is one such field wherein new findings come up everyday that get published as primary source in journals, but not as tertiary source. Wouldn't citing information from primary source mean ""actual"" updation of information? 

Considering Wikipedia as a tertiary source in public domain, medical information updation should be allowed from primary sources. This would make Wikipedia an up to date encyclopedia.

There is a German article about a family member of mine, I wish to create an English version of the article.  A friend who speaks German fluently has done the actual text translation (eg it is better than Google Translate).

I think I know how to create a new Article in the English wiki, but I know very little about how to link it all together with the corresponding German article, or how it then fits into categories, etc.

This is complicated slightly by the fact that when looking at the German article all the wikipedia menus are in German as well.

If I write the new article as a completely new and separate topic, can I get assistance in linking it properly so it follows the wikipedia standards?

  I'm trying to understand how Wikipedia works, and I have a few questions. I'd really appreciate if someone can help me with them.

  1. If I create a page using the Article Wizard, what happens to it? Is there any way to bypass review and send it directly to the article namespace? If not, where does it go for review? It seems that it goes to Articles for Creation, but I thought that was where people post drafts to be reviewed - does the Article Wizard direct there, too? If so, I see there's a backlog there. About how long can I expect it to take before my article is reviewed?

  2. Once an article is moved from AfC to the main namespace, will it show up on the Special:NewPages page? Or is considered an old page?

  3. When I look at Category:Candidates for Speedy Deletion, I see a lot of pages that were created very recently and nominated for deletion after just a few minutes. Often, they are deleted just as fast. Why, then, do I follow a link from Special:Newpages and find an article that has been deleted, or even tagged for deletion? Do those articles not even make it to Special:Newpages? Should I be looking somewhere else? Are they really patrolled that fast?

Thanks so much - eagerly awaiting your answers.

I am a philosopher and have spent my life invested into the most difficult subjects of our human condition. This year was spent practically explaining the theory behind our social problems historical development, and how we could flip everything by creating quality free education, distributed on the Internet.

I do not separate my ""personal"" and ""professional"" life. I am alone in this life and spend it travelling the world, studying society both theoretically and practically while standing outside of it. I then create films that attempt to receptively reinterpret wisdom into the actions of our society's individuals. I then distribute these films for free utilising most media distribution formats including many sources on the Internet.

I would assert that I am more closely connected with my work than anyone else in the world because my heart is all in it. I live the life of an anchorite. And when the relational qualities of the dots of our constellations become clear to me, I am thrown into inspiration and then very quickly create very moving productions that will stand the test of time.

My work is all about me. But I have conditioned my psychology over my life to be all about our human condition. Thus from the reflections of me, if the work is examined in its entirety, we come to learn that my work is all about each and every one of us. I have spent my life attempting to remove bias from my thought process. And I closely examine each and every detail within my existence and contemplate different methods to understand and interpret this ""reality"" in front of me.

I am seeking an editor that has experience in philosophy to work with me to be able to create the type of articles that Wikipedia desires. I have a great amount of work but have really only started creating professional audiovisual productions recently, so my old work would not need articles on them, but may be linked as references. I will not have a problem finding additional references for the articles because that is all included in my work anyway: I am a philosophy teacher.

Me and all of my productions that I would add to this site are EXTREMELY noteworthy and will one day be in physical encyclopaedias. I have given my life entirely to all of my fellow human brothers and sisters and one day they will realise what I have done.

I do want to mention that my work is extremely controversial according to our modern society. But when we shine light over the ghosts we always find that they were only sheets draped over a chair. Dionysus is my method and Love is my game.

Thanks!

To keep from cluttering the entry for the district, I was thinking I'd try using the drop-down option and include an drop-down gallery for each of the streets. I read about this on the drop-down information page, but I can't seem to get it to work. I moved my cursor of the sample just to copy and paste it into my sandbox page to test it, so I know I'm not making some typo somewhere.

When I click on that (and I have to click on that and nowhere else in the text box to get it to execute), the resulting drop-down sample works fine.

When I click the edit link which appears to the right of References, the editing box only shows the text from 'References' down.  The two paragraphs and info box I added aren't there.  

What have I done?  Help!  :)

1801,"531845207","Is there any zero-width non-breaking space character that can be used on Wikipedia?","I was looking at the article on [[hiragana]], and I noticed that my browser inserted a line break between two characters in the text. I thought that this was undesireable (as it is one single word), so I tried inserting a zero-width non-breaking space between them (with '&amp;#8288;' or '&amp;#x2060;'). This didn't appear to do anything, but I copied the text to somewhere else to examine it further, and saw that the character was indeed there, it just did't do anything. I tried putting the character in an html document to see if it was my browser that was causing the problem, but this worked just fine.

Now, am I doing something wrong, or does this character simply not work on Wikipedia? If it does work, how do I insert it properly? If it doesn't work, are there any other characters that do, that can be used instead? I tried using '&amp;nbsp;', which worked, but obviously inserted a space between the characters.

And also, if there is any character that I can use, should I insert it between all the japanese characters in the text? (I guess not everyone will have the line break at the same place.)

1893,"533971892","Inventing a Wikpedia bot language","I have looked at [[WP:BOT]], and it seems that Wikipedia bots (which I enjoy calling [[Willy wonka|gadgeteer]] creations) are not actually different than any other kind of bot.

In other words, a bot that is designed to login to your Facebook account and gather statistics about your number of friends is not actually very different from a Wikipedia bot that logs into a WikiBot account and reads the number of articles you have edited since last Sunday.

That means, it ''should'' be possible to make a unique programming language that has special commands. Special commands designed solely to Wikipedia, such as addTemplate(""Not categorized"") or even addTemplate(""Questionable notability""), or something like that.

Artificial intelligence can be applied so that the bot would become very clever. I am not sure if anyone has already done this, but it is perfectly possible to make a contributor bot. A bot able to (partly) understand the English language. A bot intelligent enough to see that there are not enough citations. A bot smart enough to browse Google Scholar in order to get more citations. A bot able to draw free-media images and upload them automatically to Commons. Most importantly, a bot that edits Wikipedia for real. A bot that can edit Wikipedia, not by adding random templates, but by citing its sources, adding real sentences to the article, and then drawing a free-media image that it could upload to Commons and then insert into the article only where the image would be relevant. A bot that is indistinguishable from a human editor.

This is not the point of bots. Bots are supposed to only do automated tasks that would be extremely boring for human Wikipedians to carry out.

However, what if we could have a bot that could write an article better than a human? Find citations more scholarly than those of a human? Draw art (such as explanatory diagrams), save it to a file, and generate freely licensed images for Commons... better than human artists?

It would be an interesting idea.<br />

  Symbol oppose vote.svg Oppose I have three problems with this.

The first is that this appears to be a professional, posed, portrait. It looks to me very unlikely that the subject took it himself as claimed above. It is far more likely that the copyright is owned by the photographer.

The second is that the permission above is very casual. There is absolutely no indication that Mr. Bohm understands that he is licensing the use of his image for use anywhere, including commercial use and derivative works. Although it doesn't say so, I think what appears above amounts to a Wikipedia only license.

The third is that the WP:EN article-to-be (Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Lawrance A. Bohm) reads like a sales brochure for Mr. Bohm's services. I am uncomfortable with Commons supporting what looks like a publicist's work. Bradley J. Mancuso, who is our requester here and the sole author of the article at WP:EN, works for Mr. Bohm.

Therefore, as INC says above, we need both a license from the actual photographer, using the procedure at Commons:OTRS and some consideration of whether this violates COM:ADVERT. . Jim . . . . (Jameslwoodward) (talk to me) 22:31, 8 January 2013 (UTC) Bjm99c (talk) 20:39, 19 January 2013 (UTC)

I was browsing through the Articles for Creation and came across a submission that had a lot of duplication.  There was already a comment from an editor about the incorrect tone of a previous version of the article, which the author was working to fix.

Not being an expert on the subject (biomass as a renewable energy source) I hesitate to do more than slight editing, but I feel that the article would be more acceptable if all of the redundancy were left out.

And then there is one predictions article ([[Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil]]) which contains essentially those same two timelines.  But the each timeline has been edited independently for years, so they differ a lot.

The merge instructions seem to imply you will copy over all the source material and add it in one big edit, where you need to use the special edit summary ""merged content from XXX"". To do that in this case would require solving all the overlaps in the whole timeline, a lot of decisions and judgement calls. I'm wondering if there isn't an alternate procedure where you just kind of chip away at the destination page, bringing little bits over. Then when done, delete the overlapping parts on the source page. This would create more history as to all the little decisions that were made. Or is it required to really do it all in one big edit?

I so far have only made a couple of small edits on wikipedia, but when I was looking for information on SOFEX (trade fair for various military equipment) I only found something that looked like an advertisement. I would like to create this article, since this is actually a pretty big deal. A lot of money is involved and high ranking officials of various countries visit it, as well as most weapon manufacturers.
I'm having some trouble finding reliable sources, but my most pressing question is actually about something else, namely, could you direct me to an example of a good article about a related subject? I found the bilderberg conference page, but I don't think I can find that much information about SOFEX to be honest. I also don't really know about similar events, so I'm a bit lost even on how to start this. Is there also a general guideline on layout I should be aware of before starting this?

Summary of question: where do I go to get semi-protection for an article? Some new editors are adding material en masse that is not referenced at all--no sources of any kind, let alone reliable secondary sources.

Background: Over the past month, I have done quite a lot of research on Yin Yoga, in order to improve the article of the same name on Wiki, which had been flagged as having multiple issues, including major contributions from someone personally involved with the subject, and improper reference to self published sources. 

I rewrote the first half of it, referencing each significant point to reliable secondary sources. I was about half way through the rewrite, making about 100 edits.

Then yesterday, someone came in, a couple of editors obviously very new to the site--they have no talk page history--and added a lot of material (about 600 words) to the beginning of the article that is not referenced at all. It is like an essay, but with no footnotes. Today I reverted their edits, due to this major problem with them.

I'd like to work with these people since they are knowledgeable, and will leave notes for them on their talk pages, but in the meantime, would it be possible to get some kind of protection for this page? I remember that one article I worked on last year (Wayne Gretzky) was semi-protected, so that only editors with some level of experience could work on it. Did I understand that correctly?

I don't want to write an article about him and have it get deleted.

I wrote a short summary about him so that you can get an idea of what this man has accomplished. Also, not written yet, is that there may be a movie being made about him in the future, but that isn't a sure thing yet:

Dan Bigley (born 1977) is an inspirational speaker, author, and the director of foster care for Denali Family Services, an Anchorage nonprofit counseling center serving emotionally disturbed children and their families. On July 14, 2003, during a fishing trip in Alaska, he was mauled by a Grizzly bear and lost his vision. His story was the subject of an episode of the television series ""I Was Bitten"" that airs on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel. He is now a public speaker that gives inspirational talks to groups around the United States about how to keep living after going through a traumatic experience, and on September 30, 2008, was honored as Alaskan of the Year for his efforts. He is now in the process of writing a book called ""Beyond the Bear,"" with the release set in Spring 2013.

A colleague of mine has taken up one of them but I'm having trouble with the other. The citation is needed for this statement:
'''<blockquote>In theory, realistic computer animation can reach a point where it is indistinguishable from real action captured on film. Where computer animation achieves this level of realism, it may have major repercussions for the film industry.</blockquote>'''

I'm struggling to find where this information could be sourced from to verify the statement as being correct. Personally I feel the wording of 'may' doesn't stand strongly enough either way. So, my questions are, firstly: Where would you suggest I look to verify the statement? and secondly: If you find a statement to not be true, what is the policy? Do you remove it and explain your reasoning or do we talk about it and then follow the general consensus from the replies?

2152,"539242282","Another user has undone changes s/he disagrees with, but that accurately reflect the field","Hi

This is a newbie question. 

I made a minor change on an article, a change which signalled that there was a major scholarly controversy in the field in question (there is no consensus position on some basic methdological, defintional and analytical issues). I made the change because the page is currently constructed in a way that ignores this debate, instead presenting the view of one side as the accepted view - effectively, one position is naturalised on, and promoted through, wikipedia. I am NOT suggesting that this is deliberate, or malicious, action - merely that the page would more accurate if this major controversey was acknowledged, and that its absence does significantly compromise the accuracy of the article.

A more senior user undid the change, commenting ""reverting to previous version since the new proposed version was quite different and nothing was argued for the specific changes"".

1) What did I do incorrectly?
2) If the change is consistently removed by that user, what recourse do I have?

On 6 July 2012 I made the following edit on Kayden Kross's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayden_Kross) page:

""From June to September 2011 Kross co-presented fourteen podcast episodes of Kayden's Review (http://trigg.la/episodes/kaydens-review/) with the comedian Dane Hanson. The podcasts were for Trigg.la (http://trigg.la), a spin-off podcast and blogging website operated by Kevin Spacey's TV/film production company Trigger Street Productions.""

It was deleted 3 days later by MikeWazowski (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MikeWazowski) as ""unimportant"".

In recent years the mainstreaming of the pornography industry and the sexualization of the media has become a matter of much discussion and research. The podcasts were all filmed at Trigger Street's offices and I felt it was a valid point of interest that such a mainstream name / company should have this association. More recently Trigger Street Productions has announced it is set to make the film version of ""50 Shades of Grey"".

I was going to contact MikeWazowski but clicking on his user name I see that he is a prolific and experience editor and I think he may just argue against it on notability grounds. I thought, therefore, I would ask here first for advice about the 'note-worthiness' of contributions.

However, this list has not only the names of fiddlers, but their nationality and fiddle styles.  If I copy all of the references from the various pages, there will be hundreds of them.  Also, this page will be edited by a lot of people wanting to add fiddlers, and it's easy to mess up tables. I would like to indicate beside each fiddler's info in a brief and simple way, after checking, that the fiddler's article adequately references the facts shown.  I could use a named ref tag, and have the reference text say ""References for this information may be found in the article about this fiddler"".

I've recently (this week) uploaded two images to Wikimedia Commons. To make things easier, let's just call one Image A and Image B. Image A is an image of a person which is the founder of an organisation and is used in my submitted AFC page, while Image B is an image of a Logo of an organisation and is used in an article. Both were tagged with copyright tags cc-by-3.0 which appeared in a box when saved. NOTE: Image A(person) is actually the founder of the organisation which the logo is also Image B.

Here's what happened, after I logged out of Wikipedia and check back into both my submitted AFC page and the article and clicked both of the images, I realised that both Image A&B copyright tags (boxes) are gone. 

Image A have a box with red lining and a 'no entry' sign stating that, 'This media file does not have sufficient information on its copyright status. Unless the copyright status is provided, the file will be deleted seven days after this template was added:(20 February 2013)... And also another box which is orange in color with an orange 'C' stating that, 'The uploader did not provide sufficient information (a valid and suitable tag) on this media' s copyright status. Unless the copyright status is provided, the file could be deleted seven days after the upload (20 February 2013)..'

Image B in other hand only have one box which is the orange box with an orange C just like Image A also the same date.

The date about deleting the images freaked me out and I dint know what to do. And also I would like to know if both of my Images are suitable to use the 'cc-by3.0' tags.

Below are my images link and information:
Image A : The owner of Image A attached his photo and e-mailed to me when I told him I needed his photo for creating him an article when I reached out to him from the org official website. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Liam_Hackett.jpg
Image B : I downloaded Image B from the organisation's official website, the organisation stated in the website that 'feel free to download our images'.

I have started contributing recently. It really started when I was doing some research on the star biographer Mohan Deep as I am writing a paper on him for my doctrate. 
I noticed that there was a lot of one sides info - in Madhubala page - and corrected it with sources. Yet, I saw today that someone removed the material though I'd provided sources and links.

I also plan to do such additions in two other articles - Meena Kumari and Rekha.
More important, I am writing an article (with sources and references) on Mohan Deep. But what do I do if someone who, for whatever reasons, removes my content?

I have already written the draft but have yet to submit the article. I understand the requirements for being neutral, sources and references. Would like help.

    Warning: This page should probably be located at Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/sandbox (move).
    Warning: A page with this title exists. Please make sure that this proposed article does not already exist or that it does not need to be moved to a different title.

There's also a red note about a missing reference, but I have subsequently removed all the citations (I think) and replaced them with hot links to URLs because they are easier to use and less trouble to create.

I have done a fairly extensive re-write over the past few days and assume the readers will access the latest, which is the cleanest and most suitable for review.  Please advise.

The other important point about Patrol 36 (versus Patrol 35) is that 36 (the number) is twice 18 - in effect, the name ""Patrol 36"" reflects the fact that it is the second style of group built along the lines of the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 (but is not a scion thereof, such as White Wolves): two times 18 is 36! (Not, of course, 35... To find out why ""18"" is so central to neo-Nazi ideology, check out Wiki's own article on Combat 18.)

2290,"542243823","misc. questions on editing a discography","I've been doing some work on [[Rory_Gallagher_discography]] I'm pretty much a novice and as I've been working have some random questions.

1) Is there any policy about copy/pasting from Wikipedia article to another? I started by copying some relevant text about Gallagher's recordings from his main page into my sandbox and then modifying it as needed to make it appropriate for the discography. But I found that some sections pretty much worked as is with minimal editing. I'm assuming that is OK and that some repetition is logical in an encyclopedia. 

2)  Some of the text that I copied seemed to be formatted a bit strangely. I've already cleaned most of it up (and plan to look back at the original and clean that up as well) but I was wondering are there, there must be, automated tools I can run over a page to find common problems (e.g. links to disambiguation pages) too many line breaks, etc. before I publish the page? For any programmers reading kind of what Lint does for C programs. 

3) Is it permissible to reference album liner notes? If so any good examples of such a reference?

4) As I was linking to other pages I came across this page [[power_trio]]  It makes sense to me that there is a page for this topic but IMO the current page doesn't meet Wikipedia standards at all.  It reads like original research (much of which I don't agree with, I love John Lennon but Plastic Ono Band is a Power Trio?) and there are really no reliable references. My first instinct was to just delete most of that page and replace it with a boiler plate stub of text that has the basic definition for a power trio (IMO it should only be bands like Cream and Jimi Hendrix Experience) but I don't want to get into a war with whoever wrote all that text and I also feel if I'm not able to write anything substantial on the topic yet I shouldn't delete all the text that is there. Any opinions?

I've never posted here before although i've made about 4,000 edits over 3 years.

I wrote an article on a difficult and sensitive topic, and it has been deleted per [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Definitions of Pogrom]]. It is now userfied at [[User:Oncenawhile/Definitions of Pogrom]].

The two main questions raised in the AfD were whether it was notable enough as a standalone topic and whether there was any A+B=C synth. Most editors thought they knew the answer to these questions, perhaps due to the sensitivity of the topic, but few if any read the actual underlying sources on which the overall gist of the article was based. That of course leaves me unsatisfied, primarily because i was unable to convince editors to invest the time to read the scholarly works to allow them to come to a more considered view. In other words, because i feel almost noone bothered reading the main underlying sources, I have no idea whether the decision to delete was really right.

My question for the teahouse is, assuming for the sake of argument that my belief in the underlying veracity of the article was correct, what could i have done to convince editors and commentators to actually read the underlying sources before taking a view in the debate?

For the avoidance of doubt, my question for the teahouse is NOT whether you agree or disagree with the AfD - that bridge has been crossed and I have accepted it - and so i don't think it's worth anyone's time here going over it again. I just want to learn what to do differently next time so i end up with proper closure.

Thanks in advance for any advice or thoughts on on this.

What would be the policy if, as employees of AR, we created general profiles for these women and added at the bottom their articles, which all go into details about their careers? Would that be acceptable?

Second, the DATA 2000 Act allows physicians (and only physicians, not medical professionals) with specific qualifications to get a waiver to prescribe Schedule III, IV, and V opioids for opioid addiction without following the registration requirements of the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act. In short, it allows registered physicians in a community setting, unaffiliated with opioid treatment centers, to prescribe drugs like buprenorphine.

The existing categorizations by nationality and country were not what was wanted for two reasons:  First, they gave popes a nationality by other criteria than where they were born; second, they didn't say what continent they were born on, leaving the reader to figure it out by reading the article to find the birthplace, then either knowing what continent that country was on, or in some cases having to use an atlas to see what continent the birth-city was on (because some nations have parts on two continents).  So I went to the pages about those eight popes and added [[Category:Asian popes]] to the list of categories.
But here's my problem; I don't know that I put it in the right order among the categories.  I know I should consider both the alphabetical order of the categories' names and the relative importance of the category.  But I don't really know how to judge that.

I also plan to write an article about unauthorised biographers in India which will be about all the people who have written unofficial biographies in India.
The situation in India is such that any such book and writer is hounded out if the subject has connections.

please be kind--i'm a total novice here.

i ran into a problem when i wanted to do something as simple as leave a comment in the 'talk' section about what i had edited.  i found all sorts of info and guidelines about what to say and how to say it, but i couldn't find any instructions on where to start--where to type in the text.

then, i came to the help section, and had the exact same problem...i clicked on the 'teahouse' link, and after going through several pages, i eventually found this one with a button that allowed me to enter text. whew!

maybe it's done for a reason, maybe i'm just slow and missed it, or maybe this is an oversight.  well...here i am, and the main thing i need to know first is how to type text into the talk page.

another question i have... is there a tutorial specific to footnotes?  obviously, footnotes are a core element for any post--no matter how short or long--but there isn't an overt footnote information guide as part of a beginner's introduction to editing.  plenty of instructions about the importance of footnotes, but nothing 'in our face' about how to code it.  i haven't done an extensive search, but then again, given that it's a key part of all entries, it would really help to not have to go searching--but to have that in a very visible place.  maybe, again, i'm blind and it was right there, but every time i saw something about footnotes, it wasn't related to the technical aspect of how to insert and code them.

last question...is it allowed to just start a page on a subject that needs to be covered--as a means of encouraging others who have the knowledge to flesh it out?

any help with these issues would be greatly appreciated.

p.s.- i don't understand how these tildes work, so please forgive if i get it wrong...

2448,"546778684","Articles ""watched"" and ""protected"" from changes by original author","Recently, while correcting typos here and there, I happened on a bio article which, to me, seemed to require some attention. Because I was there and noticed the improvements required to bring the article up to what I perceived as standards for a biographical article, I tagged the article with multiple cleanup templates.

Back again today to ponder more typos to fix, I noticed that the templates I added to the article were deleted by the original author.

Now, I know that I could do a few things, such as replace the templates, and/or start a discussion on the Talk page of the article around bio article standards, etc. - which would essentially turn into a debate if the author decided to dispute my thinking.

A few things about me: I'm not interested, one way or another, about the fate of the specific article; I would like to learn; I feel I need support/ help in this situation. Thanks.

I would like to know a few things:
* Is the article indeed in need of cleanup (specifically, multiple: re-organize, copyedit, verify)?
* Is it okay that the original author rushes in and removes others' templates?
* If the original author shouldn't just remove others' changes, what should be the preferred recourse?
* If cleanup is required, would one of the Teahouse folks mind handling or requesting more seasoned help to handle this situation?

2451,"546893949","Best practice - or How to do it?","Hello All,

The life-blood of Wikipedia is to my mind, collaboration and consensus. Especially when the topic has different standards in different countries.  The problem I have is conversations - where should they happen?  On the talk page for an article - no problems there.  But recently. I have had conversations, where I am posting on a fellow editor's talk page and he is then answering on mine - forwards and back, like table-tennis. The full conversation is not visible and then we both tend to repeat ourselves. Bad enough when there is only one point being debated, but disaster when there are various points.
So, should the debate happen on the talk page, where it started? And if that is my page, how do I alert the other editor that I have replied?  Thanks Everyone.  [[User:Kiltpin|Kiltpin]] ([[User talk:Kiltpin|talk]]) 11:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)"
2452,"546905927","Private emails and talk pages","If you received email from a well-known person, because you wrote and asked about their views on something, I know that absolutely ''cannot'' be used as a source in an article. But can it inform whether a quote published in a RS is included in an article? In this case the debate was whether a quote ""reflected poorly"" on a quotee because it was in an interview and maybe was a ""casual remark"". I think some editors felt including the quote was a form a [[Wikipedia::Cherrypicking]], not because the quotee ever expressed conflicting views, but just because perhaps we were including the harshest version of those views and maybe the quotee felt bad about that particular formulation. So I wrote the quotee, explaining it was research for a Wikipedia discussion, and they said that to this day that quote ""expresses my feelings quite accurately"". Now on the one hand this seems to completely resolve the debate. On the other hand I see problems with private correspondence, even just on the talk page. I imagine popping up and saying ""he wrote me the answer is yes"" might not go over well. Firstly some editors might just not believe me, because in fact there is no way to prove it. Secondly editors might write the poor person, who has a public email address, to get individual confirmation. It's sort of a weird thing, it seems like super useful information, but it seems hard to use it. [[User:Silas Ropac|Silas Ropac]] ([[User talk:Silas Ropac|talk]]) 13:37, 25 March 2013 (UTC)"

2497,"547927153","Shortage of sources and information","A month ago or so I was reading about one of my favorite football clubs and viewing the players in it and the articles about them. I noticed at least one did not have it, so I decided to make his. After seeing several other articles about the other players being as short as one or two sentences, I thought it would suffice with the exact same ammount of sentences and sources etc. for this one.

To my surprise, the submission was declined a few days ago, and the demand was that I should write more about the player's biography and give more sources. But the problem is that this particular player happens to be eccentric, not too famous, not well-known, though I was curious about who he was and I figured others might be too so that's why I made it in the first place. 
Nevertheless; I don't know if I'd be able to write more than a paragraph about him and I'm bugged over the fact that the other articles didn't need much to pass while they could surely fit in much more about those more famous players than this one who has yet to even play his first game for the club and is not that known.

So I wonder:
1.How much is the bare minimum of text beyond which nobody can reject the submission?
2.What should I do if I don't have enough info to work with in order to write that much?[[User:Azrail Kabir|Azrail Kabir]] ([[User talk:Azrail Kabir|talk]]) 03:46, 31 March 2013 (UTC)"

2503,"548140586","Need tips on neutrality, tone/personal opinion, and argot for human vulnerability page","Just posted my first wiki page, but it is in threat of being deleted for neutrality (or lack thereof) issues. Suggestions for improvement welcomed. This is the link to the page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vulnerability_to_climate_change_in_the_Caribbean

A few questions:
1. Is the term ""Human Vulnerability"" at issue? The term is not one of my making but is a new way of looking at how people at risk, especially from environmental change, are measured and impacted. The page was not meant to be an opinion piece. If there are ""opinion-like"" entries, please point them out specifically so I can edit them accordingly.

2. If the term ""Human Vulnerability"" is not at issue, perhaps the opening definition is too long? Could this definition be a better alternative:

Human Vulnerability
A human condition or process resulting from physical, social, economic and environmental factors, which determine the likelihood and scale of damage from the impact of a given hazard.
It is found on an website India website. The definition is concise but (see the link below) it is written in anther language (Hindi?) and may not be generally agreed upon by academics/scientists.   
http://bsdma.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=158&Itemid=276

3. Not sure what terms are considered argot. Can someone provide specific examples? 

4. Since the page was originally posted, over 30 references have been added. Are references still an issue and if so, is it the type, the number, or the format of the references that are still the issue?

Thanks and Be well.

I have been editing for almost 2 years ( mainly on Commons (1000+)).  Some time ago, over there, I was told that I had been given Autopatrolled status. I had neither asked for nor sought it, but it was nice to be recognised for one's efforts. It seems that these statuses (or whatever they are called) are not transferable across the WMF and have to be earned in each of the various 'departments'.  So how does it work?  Is it down to time served, or edit count, or articles created, or having the right friends?  Do I just stand around on the corner of Hollywood and Vine and hope that a producer with a fat cigar will come along and make me a star?  We hear about Administrators and Bureaucrats and Patrollers and Autopatrollers and Reviewers, but where do they all fit in and how does one get from one to the other.

I read about this new technology on the web (recyclebots)-- tried to look it up in wikipedia and it was not there so I thought I would start a page -- I was familiar with wikipedia editing from before when we did it in school awhile back - so knew about licenses. I pulled text from two wikis with compatible licenses -- cleaned it up and then went away from my computer for a few hours. When I got back it had been marked for speedy deletion because of G12 and G11- and already deleted before I could do anything. I tried following the multiple paths in the messages on my talk page to reinstate it - the editors or bots took it out and then took out my arguments for it as well -- without responding. The only thing still pending is this (I think) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion#RecycleBot
I'll be honest this is a little bit frustrating as I spent a good bit of time on it and I know this is why a lot of people dont bother editing because new stuff gets smashed. I am pretty sure I could fix anything that was promotional or was a copyright vio -- but I dont even think there were any-- that said I can't find a way to get to the original text to read through it carefully anyway.

The photo that I did manage to upload is a college yearbook pic from 1932 which I found during a genealogical search on ancestry.com.  I called the company directly to ask about the availability of the use of the photo.  The employee went to the manager and got back to me stating that the photos from their yearbook areas were public domain and free to use.

When I tried to mark the appropriate sections during the uploading third degree, submenus would pop up asking for copies of licenses and other impossible-to-obtain items, before it would allow me to complete the process (I somehow got the yearbook photo through, but with warnings that it might be taken down if I didn't provide the appropriate whatever).  I tried to explain the series of events with ancestry and begged whomever not to take the photo down since it was public domain.  That's when I got this invitation to the Teahouse (thank you whoever is that guardian angel).

I have other photos provided to me by Burt's daughter--a photo ID from Burt's Olympic ID card in 1932, photos of he and his oarsmen, photos from newspaper articles credited to Associated Press and other outfits from '32 etc.  

Shall I just forget about uploading any additional photos that I think will help flesh out the article or continue to attempt to run the gauntlet without getting terminally whacked?  Who would own these private collection pictures other than Burt's daughter, who would gladly give permission to use them on Wiki?

I'm new to Wikipedia and need your advice. My first attempt at contributing ended in an administrator accusing me of ""vandalizing"" and blocking my account. He was very territorial about a certain webpage he seemed to protect in the interest of a resourceful British law firm. He finally told me I should go and draft an article on a separate page but not ""mess around"" with the existing one. When I tried exactly this, the result was someone else deleting this page because he felt the content was ""too promotional"". Now the thing that is shocking me: this new entry was actually written in the same style and structure as the other one. 

So either there is random admin behaviour or some are ""more equal than others"". What course of action do you recommend? Is there a way to restore my initial belief that Wikipedia is about free sharing of knowledge?

Looking forward to any ideas.

I've spent a fair amount of time learning things around wikipedia, including proper markup, have gone through helping to clean up backlogged AFC (about 40 articles so far), updated various other minor pages and categories and created another article that is being discussed. I am really trying to understand how to help out and add new articles around here. This process is pretty frustrating.

I am very confused why this article is being judged so tough. It does seem to be penalized for submitting to AFC first, as many other articles get approved with no question with way worse sources than i've submitted here (not that that is ok) but not sure why there is little help on this and lots of simply ""its wrong, advertising and pull it"". Many wiki entries for people in the social media industry/internet personalities are left with ""could use more sources"", ""additional clean up"" or even stub articles. It is very discouraging to a new user to have hours of work immediately removed and deleted and certainly makes me not want to help out if everything just gets shot down because senior editors happened across it in the AFC. I've spent a lot of time to try and do things correctly.

I then have spent a fair amount of time on these deletion page responses going through my reasons for why I thought this was an acceptable article. The few other responses from editors on the page have used words that I don't understand why they are being used.  Like ""puffery"" and they feel that each interview with the person is a ""press release"" while they look like interviews to me. I don't understand why a major site like about.com is to be discounted and by why several 3rd party impartical blogs close to the subject, dont have any value.  I have no idea what 'usification' means, even for googling it.  One person just linked to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LOTSOFSOURCES#Lots_of_sources which from what I read is not to be used as an acceptable argument for deletion.

All in all I'm very confused. 

I understand after working around here a bit the last few months that wiki gets a fair amount of garbage self promotion articles for companies and people and why editors will be strict, But I really hope someone in here will spend some time with me on this, explaining why this ""doesn't count"" without using words that seem rather attacking to me, when i'm only trying to learn around here.

I've had the following comment appear on a page I've edited on the Macular Society.

""The topic of this article may not meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines for companies and organizations.""

The Macular Society is a national UK charity with more than 15,000 members and 260 support groups. It was established in 1987. I feel this has significant notability, particularly for the 500,000 people in the UK living with macular degeneration! 

As a Wikipedia beginner, how do I show that this notability exists? So far I have referenced the Charity Commision website and Scotish Charity Regulator.

I have looked at other organisations such as Blind Veterans UK, who seem to have similar pages but does not have the notability comment.

Any help would be gratefully received.

Also a lack of sources'

Despite adding a source from an in-print article in R2 Rock'n'Reel magazine (which surely is a decent source...) I wonder as to how a 6 year old band with 2 albums under their belt (and apparently the third on its way) that performs frequently and is well known enough on the circuit that you hear talk of them isn't notable.

I guess if it was for George Lucas, it would be a household name, but Dev has written more scripts! And seen by more people! They just don't know it, since they were children watching T.V.
The article was marked for a rapid deletion for not being ""notable"".  When I listed over 60 different screen credits, all with sources, and that only being her various animated television series, from Darkwing Duck to Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers, from Clifford the Big Red Dog to The New Adventure of Winnie-the Pooh, etc., the table grid (in a Wiki approved format) was deleted for being ""resume"" like.  When I add information it is deleted, then told the article is not substantiated or notable by another editor.  
Dev also has written live action and children's books, the latter endorsed by Oprah Winfrey, but those weren't included, as the grid was focused on only television animated series. 

Right now, I have asked that the ""deletion"" notification box be removed from the page as I have had two other related articles ""speedy deleted"" by new administrators.  The box has been there for more than 10 days and the editor says he is waiting for ""notability"", yet adding that Dev has written for more than three major channels (ABC, Disney, PBS, Disney Afternoon, Fox, etc.), as well as straight to video, her own book series, etc., and have proven she is award winning, is not cutting it.  This editor refuses to believe that anyone arbitrarily deletes anything, yet that is why there are complaints and wonderful zen like places, such as the tea house, where we can remember to breathe, right? 

I clearly had labeled the article as a ""stub"" and am now becoming an expert on this person, the point that I took my laptop to the library out of the house for research, and it got wet in the rain...you guessed it...tax refund is going to pay for a hard drive recovery :( It's a good cause as this writer chose to work on scripts that were only about morals and love for children, during the 1990's and early part of this century.  Your guidance is truly appreciated!   Also, is there a way to be assigned a mentor so I am ""protected""? Someone who is familiar with writing biographies so they understand that we can list items without it being a ""resume"" or advertisement?  I have no personal gain in this. Dev is listed throughout Wiki. This started as a place to give a bio on who she is so other places could link to it. Now I'm frustrated and heart broken every time I'm ""deleted"".

My arguments were that the references in Wikipedia and in the other places where this term, ""axiom of global choice"", appears, have no mentionings of it, and second, people who were trying to explain the meaning of this term did not succeed. Recently I asked the authors of this article in Wikipedia what they meant when writing this, and the results are here  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Axiom_of_global_choice, and as a corollary.

2713,"553126244","Corrections of bad punctuation reverted","Hello all. Since having joined not long ago I've been adding commas to articles where they have been missing. These are commas that are required to set off non-restrictive appositives. Here are some examples:

''London, England, is the largest city in Britain''
''Charles, Prince of Wales, is a member of the British monarchy''
''She was a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, for five years''
''I'm on holiday from June 1, 2013, onwards''

There are many occasions on Wikipedia where the second comma isn't present, and thus the sentence is ungrammatical. It also distorts the meaning of the sentence. The second commas aren't optional. They must be present for the sentence to make sense.

Some such corrections I've made recently were reverted and challenged. Two editors both thought I was adding serial commas. One editor thought it looked like there were too many commas. This is where some people get confused. I'll demomstrate with some lists.

The first sentence below contains a serial comma, the second doesn't. The serial comma is, of course, optional. It's not required for most sentences to make sense. (In some cases it helps but let's not get into that now; let's not complicate things.)

''He was educated at Eton College, Rugby School, and Magdalen College, Oxford.''
''He was educated at Eton College, Rugby School and Magdalen College, Oxford.''

Now let's say that our fictional student, he, whoever he is, didn't go to Eton at all but instead continued his studies at the Sorbonne.

''He was educated at Rugby School, Magdalen College, Oxford, and the Sorbonne.''

That's a list with three items. The comma after ''Oxford'' is required because it closes the appositive of ''Magdalen College'' which is ''Oxford''. This comma can't simply be removed. Without it, the sentence's meaning is different.

I managed to explain to some editors why the absence of a comma in such a place is wrong. But two more editors simply don't understand or haven't attempted to. One says that they don't want to get into a ""pedantic discussion"" and that my edits look ""like an ttempt to enforce one variety of English on articles it doesn't belong to""

My edits haven't been accepted and that seems to be the end of the matter. The error still persists on the article.

Jonathan Hammond, Solar Architect
b. 1944 is a prize winning architect specializing in passive solar design and sustainable building materials.

Jonathan Hammond played a pivotal role in the emergence of passive solar architecture in California. Twenty five years before the formation of the LEED guidelines for Green Building Mr. Hammond helped develop the first climatically adapted building code (Davis, CA). This encouraged passive solar design for heating and cooling, and his firm helped guide the training sessions with builders.<1> These guidelines, which included shading and orientation, were very successful and much more flexible and powerful than the replacement state code (Title 24) and remain better than both state and federal building codes.

Or am I branded for life as a rule breaker who is religiously, politically, and psychologically motivated and possibly banned from ever participating in the Copernican Principle page again?

2748,"554332748","I think I need a disambiguation page","Hi,

I posted this on the Talk page for the page I'm asking about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Raw_Engineering, but I was told on Twitter I should ask the question again here.

The company I work for is often getting confused in media because the Wikipedia page with our name is associated to a company that is no longer known as raw engineering. Obviously we don't want to change their page or anything, but a disambiguation page would likely make sense to clarify that raw engineering at rawengineering.com is not the same as the raw engineering at the above URL (although the link on the right panel is right, many people don't look that closely).

My sister wrote three historical novels, one made into a TV movie/miniseries starring the then-unknown Angelina Jolie. The movie in in perpetual reruns on cable TV. The Wikipedia article probably has a fair number of hits.

To remedy my stumble, I put in sources for every paragraph, quoted from the books themselves and from the book jackets, and I think kept a very neutral voice. The earlier version had been put up by a fan, using two sources, and enthusiastic language. The errors began in the first sentence, when it said she was born in Seguin, Texas, but she was born in San Antonio. I forget the other errors of omission and commission, but the article was replete with them.

Now any editor can get up in arms and delete my rewrite. The article will revert to the erroneous jumble it was before.

So how can we now resolve the desire for accuracy with the rules about impartiality?

I'm new to the Teahouse and this is my first question.  I did check the archives but didn't see an obvious answer so I decided to post, here.

I've been working with the guidance of a couple of WP admins to build a solid company page.  As per WP policies, I'm using a subpage off of my User Page as a sandbox for article development, with the intent to publish the article to production, later, through a formal ""move"" command, when the article is deemed ready.  In the article, I'm using an infobox that I'd like to add a company logo/image to.  It appears that images don't have ""state"" and, therefore, there appears to be no such thing as a sandbox image that can later be ""moved"" to production, along with the article.

Is this correct?  If so, then do I simply just upload the image to the general production space, even before the article is approved?  If not, is there some other way of handling this that is considered to be preferable and/or correct?

Thanks for any assistance you can offer.

ScarletRibbons and Revent, thank you for your help, but I'm afraid you are both quite wrong. Please read what I wrote again and also read my talk page.

Deor, thank you for comments, which I agree with. I will use semi-colons where I can. The bigger problem on Wikipedia, though, is not non-restrictive appositives that appear as items in lists but those that don't, the latter being the vast majority.

Demiurge and 82.45.217.156, the quote's grammar is perfect British English. But it isn't British style. It wouldn't be written by a Briton for a British audience. As you allude to, this usage stems from Americans giving the name of the state when writing or talking about American towns and cities. It's not a style I'd use readily in my own writing, and I was just using it as an example to get my point across.

To 82.45.217.156, you are of the opinion that setting off non-reatrictive appositives with commas looks more American than British. I assure you that this is most definitely part of every dialect of English. From what I've read, though, the commas are most often omitted by Americans when writing dates and the names of places, as in, ""On June 10, 2004 people had been..."" and, ""West, Texas was the scene of..."" Examples such as these can be found all over Wikipedia. They are mistakes which are, sadly, now creeping into British English. I'll fetch the references you require. And [[MOS:APPOSCOMMA]] is a brilliant idea.

When I loaded the image I did so on the basis of fair-use and that a textual description could not easily substitute for the image (the fair description in the text barely does justice to what is conveyed clearly in the image).

However I have now read the ""Terms and conditions of use for the website of the European Patent Office"" (http://www.epo.org/footer/terms.html#Copyright), the source of the image, and it makes clear that images can ONLY be used with explicit authorisation.  

- Does this override the fair use policy?  
- Should I take the image down?

2853,"556593068","[[Groove]] and [[Grove]]: common misspelling?","A month ago I found that the [[Groove]] disambiguation page had an unexplained link to [[Grove]] in it. Since ""Grove"" has nothing to do with ""Groove"", and no one would come to the Groove page looking for Grove, I removed it.

Recently the editor who originally put in the link from Groove to Grove ([[User:TheTruthiness]]) reverted my edit with no explanation. I posted on his talk page at [[User_talk:TheTruthiness#What_does_Grove_have_to_do_with_Groove]] asking why he thought the link was appropriate, and noting that if the reason is a misspelling it's unlikely someone would make that mistake. After three days with no response I removed the Groove->Grove link, along with a corresponding Grove->Groove link.

[[User:TheTruthiness]] has just reverted my edits again, citing ""as per [[MOS:DAB]] for Misspellings"". I reviewed the policy on misspellings, which says ""Common misspellings should be listed only if there is a genuine risk of confusion or misspelling"". I feel that few or no English speakers would spell ""Grove"" with two ""oh"", or ""Groove"" with one ""oh"", so his linking is inappropriate. However, I don't want to start an edit war.

So, my questions: 1) Should these links be left out? 2) If so, how should I avoid an edit war?

The article is [[wiki]] and the part in question is where it fails to describe what wiki is. It currently says ""A wiki is a website which allows people to add, modify, or delete the content via a web browser usually using a simplified markup language or a rich-text editor"" This description is ambiguous and it sounds like it has more in common with cloud computing than anything else; so any website which allows users to modify its content is a wiki? That doesn't even begin to describe what a wiki is. Wiki is a Hawaiian word for ""quick"" or ""fast"" and it's a metonymy that describes certain websites (not just one website) and their functionalities. I question the choice of wording here too. Of course ""people"" are going to operate the thing, who else would it be? the user?
The reason why this is of concern to me is because of the ambiguity of the root word ""wiki"". One could easily mistake wiki as an abbreviation for wikipedia for example.

I'm sure there were similarities, it can be pretty difficult not to be similar, but there were multiple references and much more information than the source they felt it violated.  Just because they don't want to take the time to really check it out, they just zap it all away.  If my understanding is correct, they can reject without blanking the entire thing.  

Help me out here, but it appears that Wikipedia is making it extremely difficult for new contributors to participate and become established.

2906,"557721131","Why don't editors actually check my sources","I have been in contact with a lot of different Wiki editors. No one really has a problem with my content once I start emailing, but it continues to be declined. It irks me that the reason it is declined most frequently is because sources aren't ""reliable or verifiable:.

My sources all contain links, and all link to articles from very prestigious industrial design and trade magazines. I even got so frustrated as to visit industry similar Wiki pages and use some of the reference links they had, because it seems apparent than no one understands the industry my page describes. I have used two Press Release sources, but only because other industry Wiki pages do this, and because the PR firms used are very trustworthy, re-posted by prestigious news outlets like Forbes. 

I know Wiki editors are super busy with thousands of pages waiting to be reviewed everyday, but I'm legitimately trying to offer information about processes that have been around for fifty, thirty, twenty years and yet still have limited general understanding.

2909,"557728777","could use feedback before major edit","I've been editing pages to do with rock music lately and as I keep linking to the article on the rock [[Power_trio]] it keeps bugging me in its current form. To begin with seeing The Police as the first picture on power trios doesn't seem right. And the whole article as is right now is pretty much original research. Lots of bands I've never heard of are mentioned and some of the things said are debatable at best (and all with essentially no references).  I've been trying to find a good reference for the topic but so far have really been coming up empty both with books and online resources (if someone has suggestions please let me know). I've looked at Allmusic which is a good source for basic info on Rock but they don't seem to have an article on Power Trios, just on specific bands that are such trios. I have a revised version where I've cut out about 70% of the text and left only what I thought was incontrovertable, that no one familiar with blues rock would disagree with and keeping the one good reference the article had. The revised version is in my sandbox:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mdebellis/sandbox   (I think everyone can see that if not and you do want to take a look let me know) I'm nervous though that if I do the edit I'm going to  remove someone's favorite band and might generate some controversy.

2935,"558364487","I was the founder, publisher and editor of Propaganda (magazine). Do my edits to this article need certification? ","Today, June 4th, I made a number of changes to the article on Propaganda (magazine). Some of these changes were removed and others require that I add a citation. I published and edited Propaganda from its first issue in 1982 to its last issue in 2002. I founded and owned the magazine and oversaw every aspect of it's production, distribution, advertising, etc. Everything I added or changed in the article today is true and is based on my experience running the magazine. How can what I say be accepted as true without the need to refer to citations. The original editor mentionied that I started the magazine in 1982, but failed to mention when it ceased publication, which I indicated was 2002. The original editor stated that there were 2 Propaganda videos, when in fact there were 3, which I indicated in my June 4th changes to the article. The original editor failed to name some of the most important and repeatedly covered bands in Propaganda such as Bauhaus and Xmal Deutschland, but named some insignificant and marginally covered bands such as Pig Face and Legendary Pink Dots. I tried to delete Pig Face and Legendary Pink Dots and add Bauhaus and Xmal Deutschland. And where I said that famous fashion photographer Steven Meisel contacted Propaganda to inquire about using a couple of my models, I know this to be true because I spoke with his representative and put him in touch with those models. And when I say that the press-run of the magazine reached 20,000 copies, only me and the printing company would know that for sure. I indicated that Propaganda was carried by Tower and Virgin Records - which is yet another thing which is being subjected to this citation requirement. And there is more information which I attempted to add and misinformation which I attempted to correct which are in jeopardy of being challenged or deleted. If Wikipedia editors have to have citations for everything, then a more complete and accurate accounting of events can never be achieved, because many things that occur have no published source, and in some cases published sources are inaccurate, untrue, or their information is incomplete or out-of-date. Is there no room whatsoever for first-hand experience from someone who was personally involved in the event which is being documented? How can I verify that I am Fred Berger, and having done that how can I get my own personal account of an event accepted without certification. You can contact me at my email address: fredbergerstudio@aol.com - would that be sufficient proof of who I am? And if so, will you accept what I state in my re-editing of the Propaganda (magazine) article? Because what was written prior to my attempted June 4th changes was incomplete and in some cases inaccurate, and unfortunately the correct and complete information is lacking in published sources. Truth is not just the published record, it resides in the experience and personal knowledge of the editor, in this case the principle party to Propaganda Magazine in all its facets. Please advise.

It started when user JPGR69 removed a live album from the summary discography section on the Gallagher article.  (On that page the discography as is common has a list of Gallagher's most popular albums and then a link to the actual detailed discography. JPGR69 said ""no live albums here"" meaning that in the summary discography section it should be only studio albums.  I don't agree but didn't think it was worth reverting. Then another user thought as I do and reverted the change. Now user JPGR69 has reverted that reversion and removed the live album again. I checked and at least one similar artist (Allman brothers) has live albums in the summary discography. To me the summary should be just that based on which were the most popular albums (which in both cases Allman bros and Rory would include live albums). Should I remain apathetic or is it worth getting involved in and if so what's the best way? Also, just as a curios side note User JPGR69 seems to have as their mission in life to remove live albums from summary discography sections.

3021,"560292695","Proper technique for editing a live stub article in userspace","Greetings, all.  Nice place you've got, here!

I'm doing pretty well for myself, finding most of the documentation and playing around in Userspace.  For the most part, almost all the answers to my questions are '''already''' out there, I just need to search for them, and find time to read it all.  There is one thing, however, that's leaving me perplexed.  I think the reason for that, is that the editing model used for Wikipedia may not have anticipated my kind of usage though, in software development, it's done every day.

Generally, when you edit a code module in a large project that's under a [[Revision control|revision control system]] (RCS, which is actually quite like a Wiki), what you do is first ""check out"" the code (like checking out a library book), edit it as much as you like, then ""check it back in"".  It seems like Wikipedia has only half this model.

All the new user articles seem to be geared for creating brand new articles out of thin air.  But it's much more likely, these days, that a new user, like myself, will want to expand an '''existing''' stub article into a full feature.  I'm not talking about a minor edit.  I mean essentially a whole new article, but built on an existing stub, rather than just thin air.  I understand the idea of creating a new article in userspace, submitting the article for review, then moving it into mainspace. I think that's a '''very''' good model, giving newbies a chance to get their feet wet, taking as much time as they need, before the experienced folks start criticizing them, but then being able to get constructive comment when they're ready, working '''cooperatively''' with experienced editors.  Excellent model, imho.

But what if you want to take a [[Manikin|live stub]] into userspace (retaining the edit history), turning the ugly ducking into an [[User:Djdubay/sandbox/Transparent men|ugly swan]] (Very rough draft, nowhere near finished!  The majority of the stub text appears in the [[User:Djdubay/sandbox/Transparent men#Transparent Anatomical Manikin (TAM)|Transparent Anatomical Manikin (TAM)]] section.), submitting the article for review (thereby turning it into a beautiful swan) and then move it '''back''' into mainspace?  The first move, live stub to userspace, (actually a copy, not a move) is known as a ""check out"" and the second move, userspace to finished article in mainspace, is known as a ""check in"".  If I understand things correctly, WP only implements the ""check in"" part, but not the ""check out"".

Of course, one foreseeable shortcoming of this approach is that the live stub could be edited independently while the userspace copy is being developed.  This can be avoided by placing a banner template indicating that an article has been ""checked out"", with a link to the userspace page, and recommending that proposed edits be discussed on the appropriate talk page.  Another shortcoming is having one user monopolize a page for an indefinite time, but there are ways to control this.

The problem of '''not''' checking articles out is that the edit history of the original stub gets lost, like in my case.  I actually stopped developing this article, once I realized about the edit history problem, so that I don't get myself in too deep into having to re-do it properly.  I'm sure I'm not the first, nor the last, to join WP with an RCS mindset.  I suspect it's been debated long and loud, but as a newbie, I'm blissfully ignorant of such debates.  What has been the consensus on this issue?

Perhaps some of you experienced and wiser folk could create a page on expanding a stub article for newbies, with the model of editing in userspace and seeking review, like you currently do for new articles.  As part of that idea, I noticed that the <nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki> template links the words ""expanding it"" directly to the edit action, encouraging newbies to make their first draft on the live article.  I'd think it should link, instead, to the article that I'm asking for someone to write, to guide us newbies on '''how''' to do this safely.  Of course, anyone who really wants to, can just dive in, and directly click the edit tab.  But the link on the template seems to beg for a how-to article.  I know '''''I''''' could really use some guidance on how to do this properly.

Any thoughts / ideas / pages on this??

Thanks!!

There is a field I'm not sure of the meaning on and want to check. On most Kindle books there is a page number and a location displayed at the bottom. But on this eBook there is only something called ""Loc"" displayed. I've been assuming that the Location field in a book reference corresponds to LOC displayed in the book but I'm starting to wonder if that is correct. I'm editing an article right now and something odd happened that I don't understand. Right now in my sandbox:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mdebellis/sandbox  I have a new version of the article on his first album. I have two references to the same book one with Location = 836 and one with Location a few virtual pages further = 844. But Wikipedia seems to have merged the two references and only uses the initial Location 836.  (BTW, it may seem like overkill to have two references so close together in the article but I'm planning on adding more text and other refs in between.) Just want to check to make sure the right way to document this.

3052,"560912414","need to rename an article","I just created a new article but I think I need to rename it. I've never renamed an article so wanted to double check before I do it to make sure I'm following the proper process. The new article is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Tour_1974   There was already a dead link to it on this page:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Palmer_(director)  so I started the page by clicking on that link and then letting it create the stub for me to which I pasted the article I had developed in my sandbox. The problem I realized after doing this is the name for the movie is just ""Irish_Tour_1974"" and there is already an article for the double live music album that came out with the movie called ""Irish_Tour_'74"" here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Tour_%2774 to me its confusing to have two articles called ""Irish Tour '74"" and ""Irish Tour 1974"".  The actual name of the film and album is ""Irish Tour '74"" so my proposed change is to rename the film article: ""Irish Tour '74(Film)"".  My understanding is to do that I click on the little drop down arrow up near the top and choose ""Move"". I assume it will prompt me for the new name. Will it fix that link and any other links? Is there any problem with changing the name of an article that has just been created? Anything I am getting wrong or should also be doing? thanks in advance.

I can see why many of the pictures for the right side do not display in the article section where they were inserted because there are so many pictures inserted in the previous sections that need to be displayed before them.

The picture for ""Springfield Avenue, the main shopping street"" is correctly displayed on the left side under ""Geography"" where it was inserted.

It seems the problem for the 3 other left side pictures is caused by the fact that the location where a picture is displayed on the left side is directly linked to the preceding picture file, which is inserted in the article's Edit text, that is for display on the right side. The picture file for the left side is not displayed, even if there is room on the left side in its inserted section, until the previous inserted picture file for the right side is displayed, which can be several sections further down.

1. Post Office - Inserted under ""Local Government, but displays between ""Media"" and ""Employers"". It is displayed opposite the picture on the right side for ""City Hall at the intersection of Springfield Avenue and Broad Street"", which is the previously inserted picture file.

The article is just in the preliminary stages and I have been researching so that I can support the concert song setlist, band members and personnel as well as critical response to the concert tour with citations.  

It is difficult to create new articles when you do not know the subject matter so I was really happy to be able contribute with an article that I knew something about.  This was pretty much my first article and I thought it was valuable to Wikipedia and it was also a big concert tour that I attended so I was knowledgeable about it as well as having a concert program from my attendance that had all the details of this 20 date national concert all across Australia playing to large venues in the capital cities as well regional event halls.  

Should I just give up on this now or can I get some tips on how to improve the article so that it is accepted and I can continue to research and improve the article.

3135,"562598456","Policy on titles and names of places","Hi. 

I believe there is an inconsistency in Wikipedia. 

I refer firstly to the English placename Staines.  The town is always known by that title, despite a 2011 resolution by Spelthorne Borough Council that IT would refer the the town by the invented name ""Staines-upon-Thames"".  It was stated at the Council's discussion that this appelation would be optional. Yet, Wikipedia (or some of its editors) has rather zealously renamed the town's article, and inserted the words ""-upon-Thames"" after most references to the town throughout Wikipedia.  It is my understanding that English borough councils are not empowered to change the names of towns - only of electoral wards. I feel that the article should be reverted to ""Staines"", and that references to ""Staines-upon-Thames"" should be restricted to a discussion of the purported renaming.

I would suggest that this would be consistent with the treatment of the US state of Rhode Island.  Even though that state legally and quite correctly has a longer title, the main article - and almost all cross references - use the name by which the overwhelming majority of people refer to the state.

Please can someone advise if I am being dumb here ... and if I am not, perhaps an editor more skilled in the mechanics of Wikipedia can set matters straight as suggested?

3174,"563068342","Article on company: allowed to include quotes from an interview?","Hello there, 
I'm writing my first Wikipedia article, and decided to write it on a company I have been studying for quite a while as part of my curriculum. 
The company is Eddy Merckx Cycles, a bike manufacturer founded by former professional cyclist Eddy Merckx. Then name of the company is quintessential to its reputation and brand name, as Eddy Merckx is considered the ""Mohammed Ali"" or ""Pele"" of cycling, in other words, the world's greatest ever cyclist. 
Now, as I wanted to know more about his vision of the brand, I interviewed Eddy Merckx a few weeks ago, and asked him why he created his company, what are important characteristics of his bikes, etc. I included quotes of this interview in the article.
Unfortunately, the reviewer of my article declined the article, partly on the basis that I should refer to ''a range of independent, reliable, published sources, not just to materials produced by the creator of the subject being discussed. This is important so that the article can meet Wikipedia's verifiability policy.''
I feel that it was rather a good idea to ask the subject of the article himself to give quotes on the 'why' of certain things in his company, and would like to keep on using the interview as a source for quotes. Is this appropriate? If so, should I upload the interview on YouTube so it becomes verifiable? 
Many thanks for looking into my question.

3256,"564482816","Reliable sources problem and dissatisfaction with formulaic rejections","Hi!  I think I may have succeeded in establishing the notability of my subject after some difficulties with this, but am now being blocked over the issue of reliable sources. I've asked the most recent editors, Techatology and Arctic Kangaroo, to specify which references they consider inadequate. Techatology seems to have been suspended and Arctic Kangaroo has a note saying he's away until October 2nd.
Some early editors were clearly constructive and helped me greatly in improving my article. More recently I have the sense that there are rules of thumb being applied without full consideration being given to the issues involved in this particular case. I find myself wondering whether the editors read the article or simply check the references.
I make it clear at the start of the article that my subject was opposed to self-promotion and claims of authorship for reasons that were integral to his practice. This has meant that there is not all that much information about him. What he has left are a couple of books that have remained in print in English since the 1950s, and there were various references to him and accounts of his work in a  few journals. Interest in his ideas is kept alive on a few websites.
Such information as there is, and these references to him and his work, are detailed in my article. I can't see what the editors are asking for.
I am extremely critical of the custom whereby editors give a formulaic rejection without providing specific details.
Is there an appeal process built in to Wiki? Latterly I have not been impressed by the quality of editing.

I was wondering if anyone had any input:  I've been working on various Rory Gallagher albums. I've done all the major ones and am starting to look at some posthumous releases, etc. One that I've found is this article: The_G-Man_Bootleg_Series_Vol.1 The current article has no references. I couldn't find the album of that name on Allmusic, Amazon, or on Gallagher's official site rorygallagher.com I also have the one and only Gallagher biography on Kindle and I did a search for that name and found nothing. There is an album with a similar name that also has an article (and that I can find in all those places) but the song lists for the two albums are totally different. I googled it and I found a few sites that look like this: http://www.last.fm/music/Rory+Gallagher/G-Men+Bootleg+Series,+Volume+1 I think what this is is a site where people create their own playlists. I think either this is someone trying to advertize their personal playlist or it was an actual bootleg album. If its the former (I think more likely) I would say just delete the article. Any ideas?

I am working on one now, and in the course of doing this, realized that I would like a list of the most common tags used for editing. (I have switched to the 'edit source' page, as it's easier to get instructions this way.) For instance, I have learned that adding {{fact}} adds the [citation needed] tag. I probably won't use this one today; I really was looking for basic tags to add when I cannot simply cleanup spelling/grammar, because the whole sentence doesn't seem to make sense without more information. I have used the tag {{what}} which adds [clarification needed]. That's probably the main one that I need. I suppose I could just suse that, but I was wondering if there were other similar tags, like a tag implying that a specific word may be incorrect. (It seems this page was translated from Portuguese into English, hence, there are some strange uses of language.)To give you an example, there's this sentence: ""His name means ""gobber"" because of his gluttonous and lazy ways."" Gobber? In this case, I can't rewrite and clarify. Should I add a clarification needed tag, or is there another tag I can put after this word, ""gobber,"" to imply that it needs to be changed?

I'm new to Wikipedia (ok, my account isn't THAT new, but I did my first edits to the English edition today!).

My first edit concerns the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_Park_characters
Under ""Major characters"" I added by whom Dougie is voiced (Trey Parker). Of course I did credit the source. Without any comment/explanation, the user Mezigu reversed my changes.

I also added some quotations to this article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_%28novel%29
Again without giving a reason, the same user (Mezigu) deleted the whole quotations-section (including those that were already there before I added more...).

I don't want to do anything wrong, so can someone please explain to me how to handle this situation? I don't even know how to contact Mezigu, so I can't ask him myself why he keeps doing this. However, if I can't settle this, my motivation to contribute to Wikipedia will be destroyed on the first day...

My second question is there was a reference (for his birth and death) to this site: http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/ All I can find on that site is a snippet (which gets truncated on my browser so its barely readable) that gives his birth date (the rest is truncated). And in any case this site does not look reliable enough to be a reference. There is nothing that says where the info comes from except a list of ""contributors"".

So I went here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PR and per the instructions I put the subst:PR text (with the correct brackets) on my article's talk page.  After editing my talk page I received a red error message, rather than a link to a new peer review page.

Subsequently Tazerdadog did something that I don't understand.  He ""moved"" my page (to ""Articles for Creation"", I think) and then denied my request for creation of an article because it was a ""blank submission"".

He then seemed to point me in the direction of the Teahouse, which is how I ended up here.  I'm just trying to get feedback on the page I wrote.  Will someone help me in a way that I understand and that actually gets me closer to the goal of getting some feedback on the page that I wrote?

3410,"567278686","Does extensive coverage really matter if a notable publisher recognizes a source with little coverage?","Hi,

I've been studying the WP Notability criteria  and I believe there is a bit of a flaw in Notability criteria for certain types of organizations and companies that don't get extensive coverage in other notable publications.

For example...
* We have a notable publishing organization (i.e. The Notable Publisher) that publishes research papers.
* The notable publishing source's research papers are automatically treated as acceptable sources by WP (and this is not the problem).
* The research papers, themselves, cite sources as references for the content within their papers.  So, for example, one research paper may cite 50 sources, some which get extensive coverage and some which don't.  However, they're all vetted by The Notable Publisher as being solid sources for the research paper (''or the paper would never be allowed to be published'').
* If the source being cited within the research paper has been fully vetted and accepted by The Notable Publisher, regardless of whether or not it has had extensive public coverage, then why wouldn't it be good enough for WP, especially since WP defers to The Notable Publisher (and does so in writing)?  (The whole reason why WP treats them as Notable Publishers is because WP believes they check their facts before allowing publication.)

The problem manifests itself on WP when WP applies the rule of ""extensive coverage"" for a source, in order for it to be ''notable''.  The fact is that if a source is notable enough to be acceptable to The Notable Publisher, then it should be automatically acceptable for WP articles (so long as it's on topic).  The fact that WP would not accept certain sources on the premise that they don't have ""extensive coverage,"" while allowing others to make it through, seems to contradict logic and also violates the rules that other notable Encyclopedias have always followed.

Examples of low coverage sources that are commonly used by such Notable Publishers include but are not limited to things like Dictionaries/Glossaries and Public Government Databases (like the US Patent and Trademark Database).

Does anyone else see this contradiction or is it just me?

My Best,

I like how individual TV episode pages are being converted into lists of episodes; seems more compatible with the notability guideline. I have been noticing a lot lately, though, that on these list-of-episodes pages, Wikipedians are providing more and more plot information per episode. It seems to me that a two- or three-sentence summary should suffice for a list article (something like you'd see on a satellite TV info dialogue), but some pages have paragraphs of plot information for a single 48-minute episode. Not only is this annoying because it gives away spoilers, but also it doesn't seem very encyclopedic in nature.

I've read the guideline that stipulates that plot summaries should be between 200 and 500 words; that length seems reasonable if a TV episode deserves its own article, but in a list, I think it's overdoing it. I was wondering if I had some sort of support from the Wikipedia rulebook when asking people to give briefer summaries in episode lists (maybe a banner template for ""too much plot"", or a guideline I could refer to when deleting extraneous content).

My problem is the every time I change what needs to be changed, like removing unsourced claims, or opinions, anonymous IP's or people with a user name but no talk page just change what I write back to how it was before I changed it, or they add in statements that are even worse. Their are boxes throughout the article stating what needs to be changed so that is what I try to do. I always explain my changes in the history and on the talk page. But I feel like I'm not getting anything accomplished on the article. Since Dance Moms is a popular show, it seems to attract a lot of fans who just don't understand the guidelines of Wikipedia and write statements that are nothing but opinions. I'm not trying to claim ownership of the article, I'm not even a fan of the show,but I have watched the show,which is why I looked up Dance Moms on WP in the first place. If anyone would care to look,they can read the history or the Dance Moms talk page to see the statements I have removed,to see if I am correct for removing them. I just feel like I'm going in a loop everyday trying to fix this article,removing the same things over and over again,yet accomplishing nothing for the article. Thanks for your time.

I've been following an article for a period of time and decided I would try to engage the community around it to try and improve it.  I have significant experience in the topic area ([[Information technology]]) and noticed that there was a flaw in the definition and thought it would be nice to contribute.  Rather than directly editing the page without vetting it with others, I thought it better protocol to try and engage the community via the talk page.  I first proposed some ideas for change and later even submitted a draft of a rewrite for a certain section.  The only responses that come back seem to be attacks, both, regarding the content and on me, and there are no attempts from anyone to work towards improvement of the article.  For example, I have one user openly writing that he knows more than me on the topic and that I know very little, and he doesn't even know who I am or what my experience might be.  I even did some research and found that one of the editors has had a history of problems with WP.

I am very sorry if I did something wrong, but I can tell you that I love Wikipedia, consider it the best available and the most democratic information source, and have never done anything to harm it's content on purpose. On the contrary, I was editing it with the best of my knowledge and abilities. 

Before I was blocked I remember I wrote a new article about Peter Jackson (environmentalist after whom the Indochinese tiger is named), as I thought he deserved a Wikipedia page. The article was deleted. I did not object to it's deletion, and never tried to start pushing the article again. 

So please explain was this the reason banning me from editing or something else? I am just lost, and hope someone can explain me what was the reason of my banning. I am ready to say sorry if I did something wrong, but please let me know what was the unacceptable behavior  that caused my banning.

3512,"568756145","Does Wikipedia REALLY want new users??","I just joined a couple weeks ago, and while I've had a bit of fun working on a couple articles, I've also had a bit of frustration and I've seen a LOT of terrible behavior and angry people here.  I'm not sure I fully understand why, but I do have a couple quick observations that seriously make me doubt that you truly WANT new users here, and that you'd much rather we all just go away and leave you alone.

When I signed up, after the account was created, the first thing Wikipedia did was stick an article in my face and said, ""here, edit this.""  I thought it was a bit strange, as to be honest, I had no clue what I was doing, but I said to myself, ""well, okay, I'll give it a try, but I hope I don't mess it up.""  So I start looking over this article with all this strange mark-up that didn't make a bit of sense at first, and slowly, I tried to decipher it all.

Of course, the article needed a LOT of deciphering on its own.  I now realize it was a machine-translated article and that machine translation generates nothing but garbage.  So I had to make sense of a subject I didn't know, totally mangled sentences that made NO sense what soever, (It she trampled opening gifted the human girl-child of 8 years.) AND a markup that I had NO clue about ... and nowhere I could go to find out what it meant.

So, slowly, over the course of the evening, I tried to make sense of it all, following by example, experimenting and trying to figure out WHAT I just did, and eventually managed to make a half-decent article out of it.

So after all that hard work, I saved the article and in a few minutes, Wikipedia finally said hello to me.  Or, to be more exact, it said that all my hard work was nothing but vandalism and that all my work was deleted from the article.

Fortunately, the message did explain that it was generated by a robot, and that it very rarely, if ever, made a mistake, but if I thought it was a mistake, I could report it and save my changes again.  So THIS is how Wikipedia says ""hello"" to a brand new user???

Well, eventually, I found my way to a page that lists articles in need of translation, and found an article that seemed interesting and that I could take care of, but mostly what caught my attention was that some editor, who I guess was in charge of the place, was very rudely telling another brand-new user (who just signed up that same day) that the new user did a TERRIBLE job, and next time he'd BETTER follow the rules!

I was actually quite offended by all that, because I had no clue what the rules were, either.  Wikipedia doesn't TELL us new users that, it just takes us and says ""here, edit this"".  Heck, I've been here two weeks now, and I STILL don't know ""the rules"" or how to find out WHAT they even ARE.

So, I left a note stating that while I understood the boss's point, I didn't appreciate his tone and that he should try being polite, and that I'd help the user with the article he was so angry about.

I did have ONE user who saw my note, and said a kind hello, which I'm very thankful for.  He also said that I should be getting an invitation to come here and a few links to some very large documents that I haven't had a chance to read yet.  Given that I had already promised to help the other user, I wanted to keep that promise and not give anyone the impression what I wouldn't keep my word, by spending a few days reading the big long documents.

So I just spent over a week on this article, really putting everything I could into it.  The friendly user did give me a couple key links to things that I don't know HOW a new user who isn't just lucky, like me, would ever learn about, which helped very much.

In the meantime, I wrote the friendly user with some ideas about how we could help make this a better place, and I guess I hit a raw nerve.  I'm not sure I understand everything that was said, but he was clearly frustrated about some nasty politics going on, here, and had a bit of a rant of his own to share.

Well, I finally finished up the work on that last article, which took over a week and a half, all said and done, but I was quite proud of it and how far I had come.  So today, what do I get?  The boss noticed the article was done, and deleted it from the list without so much as a word to me.  No thank you, no ""good work"", nothing.  I don't know if he didn't like what I did, or if he was just angry that I asked him to be polite.  Honestly, I don't think it was much to ask.

So my question is this:  Does Wikipedia REALLY want new users, or does it want all of us just to go away and leave you all alone?  My impression, so far, is that there are two kinds of users here.  New users who don't have a clue what they're doing and have no one to help them, and old, angry users who seem to enjoy telling new users that they've done something wrong ... but never trying to help them.

This is really sad, honestly, as I did enjoy what I did and I WAS proud of what I had done (but I guess it really wasn't any good, after all) and was getting excited about how I could help this place.  Now I'm not certain you really want me here ... or anyone else, for that matter.

Anyhow, I know I haven't been invited here, yet ... I don't know how long you have to be a user before you get invited ... obviously two weeks isn't long enough.  But I was told that this was the place I should go to, to ask questions and to talk about this whole how Wikipedia treats new users business.

Why are you all so angry?  Why do you think YELLING at new users is the solution??

Honestly, I do think I have a good solution ... that we should have a new user's guide ... not some big nasty document, but a really short, simple page that explains JUST the basics and explains WHERE to go to find out more.  And we should send that new user's guide automatically to every new user as part of the sign-in process.  Secondly, get rid of that new user's mode.  Let the new user READ the new user's guide first, let him explore around a bit, and WHEN HE'S READY, then give him a choice to be assigned an article.

Finally, when new users complete assignments, I'm sure that someone checks them off.  Why doesn't that person LOOK at the article, and provide some constructive comments about what kind of job the new user did, give him some tips and feedback of things that perhaps the user didn't know about, yet, etc.  Certainly, at the very LEAST just a simple THANK YOU, I think, is in order.  I know I was certainly raised to always say thank you to people who do things for you.

I guess to some people, this place is just a job.  I realize that SOME people have to run the place, and I realize when you're paid to do a job, the boss isn't going to say thank you for every little thing you do.  But for me, this isn't a job.  I'm not getting paid for this.  Is just a ""thank you"" for spending nearly two weeks of my time working for free too much to ask??  Really?

So, at this point, I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, here.  Should I spend more time reading the books I've been sent and trying to find out where all the rules are, or should I just take the hint that Wikipedia really doesn't want new users, right now, and to go find something else better to do??

I WAS having fun, for a while ... but why you are all so ANGRY?  Can someone explain what's happening here, other than the part that you probably have a bunch of new users making a ton of mistakes because no one tries to help us??

However, there are some glaring examples of fiction on this page that are treated as fact.  For example a reference to December 25th as the festival day with a reference to a Janin (1953), a French language book.  There is nowhere else in the English language a reference to December 25th as a festival day during the opening of the Hagia Sophia.  Everywhere, the date is December 27th. Without being able to read French, and having no access to Janin (1953), what do you suggest I do with regard to editing.  Elizium23 has slapped my hands on a number of edits on this page, yet allows this glaring error to stand.  How are these types of issues resolved?  

The second example is the use of the phrase ""Hagia Sophia"" for the first two churches built on the site, when the phrase ""Hagia Sophia"" was not used until much later after these churches were built.  To be correct they were referred to as ""The Great Church"" for many years as noted in a number of history books, until the third church was built.  I tend to believe these types of issues are religious in nature and perhaps offend some of the myths that have been created around this church and the evolution of Christological views.[[User:Neubauer95476|Neubauer95476]] ([[User talk:Neubauer95476|talk]]) 17:09, 16 August 2013 (UTC)"

Sorry to bring so many questions here but I was reading the [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing]] and it doesn't look like anyone visits that Talk Page so I won't get my question answered there. And I can't think of another Wiki page where I know someone might see it.

I've been spending a lot of time in dispute resolution pages, noticeboards and the like. And I  frequently see editors accused of ""disruptive editing"". But what I also see is a scenario like this:
# Editor A makes an edit
# Editor B reverts it with no edit summary provided
# Editor A reverts it back
# Editor B accuses A of ""edit warring"" or ""disruptive editing""

It seems to me that the burden should be on Editor B to explain her or his initial reversion but Editor A becomes the focus of the inquiry. Is ""disruptive editing"" just a smokescreen used to target editors one has a conflict with?

I'm not talking about a particular editor or Wiki article, I just keep seeing this charge and editors blocked indefinitely due to ""disruptive editing"" when they reverted after an initial revert that wasn't explained.

:Welcome to the Teahouse, {{U|Rhild}}. The lead of a [[WP:GA|Good article]] should summarize the content of the entire article. The current lead over-emphasizes comparisons to other major urban parks, and instead should concentrate on a concise description of this park. Some of the content pertaining to history seems to be more about the history of all of Vancouver than of the specific site that later became the park. The map that accompanies the section on World War II seems to show forts in coastal areas somewhat to the south, and does not seem to relate to the park itself.

:I did not have the time for an in-depth review, but encourage you to read the Good article standards carefully, and make your own ruthless review of the article, being sure that the lead better summarizes the entire article, the narrative does not stray from the history and description of the park itself, and that the images are the ones that best illustrate the topic.

::Thanks for the feedback. I agree with the opening being too long. The history of the park is something that was there when I started, but (A) I don't feel comfortable removing it because it was already there, and (B) I think it provides some of the critical locations and uses for the park land that would not be documented in a history of the entire city. Stanley Park is not just any park. It was in the waters directly in front of the park where Aboriginal people met the explorer George Vancouver. George Vancouver even spent a night in the park. But it did cross my mind that this history doesn't pertain to the park in the strictest sense. But then again I am pretty sure it would cause a lot of upset if Inremoved it. I have already gone through and selected images that best demonstrated the topic. The WW2 map does illustrate a larger section of the city ''including'' Stanley Park (labelled Ferguson Point on the map). A lot of people do not believe or even know that there was a fort in Stanley Park and this is a very useful map because it indicates the placement of all the forts and how they worked in concert to protect the city which is just behind Stanley Park.

:::I did not mean to imply that the lead section (the section before the table of contents) is ""too long"" as I think it could be longer. Rather, in my opinion, it overemphasizes comparisons to other parks when instead it should do a better job summarizing the full story of this particular park. If you believe the history section is important, then summarize it in the lead. But if you want to bring the article to GA standards, don't keep lesser quality content because some people might object.

:::You state that George Vancouver spent a night at the site (not the park, as it didn't exist then). I didn't pick this up in a quick read of the article and thought he had just sailed by. If this is well-documented, perhaps it should be highlighted a bit more.

:::Since I have only a sketchy understanding of Vancouver's geography, having never visited though I would love to visit that city, I had to compare the WWII map to several other maps to understand the relationship of the location of those forts to the park, which isn't labeled on the map. How could someone not from Vancouver possibly understand this map without study? Images are supposed to enlighten, not confuse. I don't recall the map showing a fort at the park, but maybe I wasn't reading it properly.

:::The image gallery at the end is not appropriate for a GA. Instead, the very best of the images should be placed in the body of the article at the points in the text where those features are described.

:::I wanted a more detailed and better referenced description of the model railroad. This may be because I am a bit of a rail buff.

:::Please don't interpret my off-the-cuff remarks as an actual GA review. Though I hope my remarks are helpful, I am just trying to get you to see the article from the point of view of an interested reader who knew nothing about the topic until your Teahouse question. Though I have mentioned perceived shortcomings, this is a very informative article, and I think that GA is an easily achievable goal for you. Good luck.

I enjoyed it in the beginning but as time went on I noticed the only people who were neighborly were the staff of wikipedia, the tearoom and others in that light. I only met one person who was willing to give me a guiding hand (a veteran to the site) and who I could bounce ideas off and who would give me hints and tips that a wiki staff couldn't do. There were the angels or fairies whatever they're called who would come and and help fix grammar and word usage as well as to do difficult tasks in regards to graphics/graphs and the such that a beginner couldn't do. The rest of the people I met were not neighborly, overly competitive, not wanting to colloborate, mean and said they didn't want to become too ""friendly"" because it would hurt the mission of objectivity in case of a dispute. While this last part may be true does it really have to be this way. I sincerely hope the tone and culture of Wiki has changed since 2 years ago and that it's more of a community now..Because isn't that supposed to be what the site is all about? A beginner is so naive and wanting to get involved and then they berated by the more mean style veterans who probably look down upon them because they don't know anything. Beginners should be treated with kid gloves in many cases I think and as they grow and develop keep reducing the thickness of the gloves until they are confident, skilled and a veteran. These are just my thoughts on the subject. What do others think?

3613,"570254713","Notability via frequent citations or importance to journal author?","Hi,

It seems that everywhere I turn, WP admins and editors only know how to use the ""it must have extensive coverage"" statement as an excuse for a source being notable.  This sounded very wrong, as in the real world, there are other things that lead to notability (which other encyclopedias also acknowledge).  For example, if a source is cited by multiple publications, even if just as a minor reference, that source is, in fact, now notable.  Also, if a source is cited ""at all"" because it is deemed important to the author, it is considered notable even if there is not extensive coverage.

I figured, if WP considers itself to be a real encyclopedia, then it should properly acknowledge the same notability that other encyclopedias or researchers find to be notable.  This led me to scour through many of the [[Wikipedia:Notability]] policies.

One editor eventually pointed me to [[Wikipedia:Notability (academic journals)]], which correctly states that (paraphrasing) notability is established if:

# a journal is considered by reliable sources to be influential in its subject area.
# Or, a journal is frequently cited by other reliable sources.

This correctly supports the fact that ""extensive coverage"" is not the only criteria that makes a source notable.  A source can also be notable if that source is cited by multiple researchers (adding up to being cited multiple times) OR if that source is considered notable to the researcher, even if just for a minor mention.

However, I can only find this explicitly written for [[Wikipedia:Notability (academic journals)|Academic Journals]] and not industry (i.e. commercial) or government journals, implying that 1) I'm just not catching it in my reading, or 2) WP does not consistently hold this criteria as being valid for non-academic journals, as would the rest of the world.

If it's a case of me just missing it in the policy documents, can someone please point me to where it is written in existing policies, as such criteria applies to industry and government publications?

OR... If I'm not missing it and my interpretation that there appears to be a gap in WP notability policies is correct, then how would someone go about suggesting such improvements to existing policy?

Thanks for any assistance you can offer.

I am really getting into editing. My favorite task is to link articles together and ""adopt"" all those orphan pages out there. I do, however, want to write a few wikis.

Right now, I am developing my first wiki. I figured something not even close to having a page in any language would be a good addition. My father was a barber for over 40 years, and I would like to use that knowledge to contribute. I decided to start with a large beauty school (since smaller organizations shouldn't be in the encyclopedia).

If anyone would be willing to, could I get some feedback on my first attempt? Any edits are also welcomed.

Another question. If an editor writes something that intrigues me, I'll often check out their contribution page to see what topics they like working on. Some times, I'll also check their logs to see their history of blocks, rights, account creation, etc., just to get a sense of how long they have been participating on Wikipedia.

Any way, for some editors, the logs are just blank. No date for creating the account, for some Admins, there is no record of when they got Admin rights.

So, I'm wondering, were there just no user logs kept in the early years (say, 2001-2004/5)? I know I can go back and look at edits to articles back to 2003 (the earliest I've come across) but it looks like their wasn't as careful tracking of users during that time.

When I examine the text box in 'Edit Source' it shows the correct coordinates. I can't find any explanation for why this would link to the other kilbride. The coordinates visible in the text box and the position of the red dot on the map of Ireland are thus incorrect.

LINKING TO OTHER WIKI PAGES 2. I have tried to link to other wikipedia articles covering relevant topics. For instance the term Eary Christian is commonly used by archaeologists and historians to describe a relevant period of Irish history - see Charles Edward Early Christian Ireland.

During a recent web-surf of Wikipedia, I came across an entry for ""Wharton Place"", an old house on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

The article appears to be part of an effort undertaken by the National Register for Historic Places to enter the information from the applications used for their registered historic places.

There has been considerable research undertaken on Wharton Place since it was added to the register 40+ years ago which corrects long-standing factual errors regarding the house, its builder, architect, etc.

Is there a way to provide the research to the contributer for the Wikipedia article for their consideration and use to update the page?

3711,"572260353","Adding location data","Hi, at the moment I have been working on displaying Wikipedia Article on a map. The aim is to give a view onto Wikipedia's articles, within a location centric context (a map!). This will, I hope, allow users to learn about the world around them.

To this end, I have been looking at Wikipedia's article location data. On the whole, pretty good. Where it does have issues though is with people. Take Anglo-Saxon historical personalities, kings, queens, abbots and so on. There are a wealth of articles on these people, but none have location data (lat long).

Now I know that location data for a person may seem odd, but I think adding this would allow them to be added to our map, and locate them within the sphere of their lifetimes influence. Usually figures have some form of location to which they can be assigned, and the lead from this can come from their title (King of Wessex) or some other location that their article outlines.

So. what do others think on this issue. I DO want to add location data for people, but I do not want to muddy the waters. What would be the best course here? I guess for many the location may not be of much interest.

Re my Articles for Creation/Contact Gallery, Norwich, 1986-1999.
This article has been submitted and declined on three occasions this year for not providing enough reliable sources to prove it was a notable organisation. I have had some good advise from the Help Desk twice by Huon and on the last occasion by Ritchie333. Ritchie333  did an internet search thus ""contact gallery"", norwich and it listed 33 books and publications that mentions the gallery, some a few words, some a sentence or two; nothing substantial. 
Ritchie333 felt that citing this source of all the books etc. might 'tip the balance' and have it accepted. I will therefore give it another try but my question is: is it acceptable to just write - search internet for ""contact gallery, norwich or is there a more technical way to cite this source. Also can you suggest any other avenues that I could try at this stage?

:Hey, AugurNZ, welcome to Wikipedia! A lot of people have that reaction to what they term deletionism.  But then, so-called deletionists would have a similar reaction to the opposite view; they would opine that having a bunch of barely-sourced articles on subjects nobody has ever heard of and about which nobody will ever care cheapens the encyclopedia by distracting from its true purpose as a reference work for ""important"" subjects.  They say that having tiny, unwatched articles just provides more targets for people to sneak in vandalism, libel, pure spam, and the like, and creates an even greater burden on the volunteers, who must patrol that many more articles.  They would prefer that the encyclopedia focus on what could be called quality over quantity.  
:Both sides have valid points, and neither side is entirely right or wrong.  For that matter, no one person has to belong to only one camp, and nobody has to follow one side to its logical extreme.

In [[List_of_Macintosh_games#O|the table I linked to above]], there are many examples showing redlinks to pages about, what could arguably be called peers or competitors of this ""Onverse"" game.

:::Hello {{U|AugurNZ}} and welcome to the Teahouse. I agree with pretty much all of what Writ Keeper said, and would like to offer some additional thoughts based on my own participation in 1645 [[WP:AFD|Articles for Deletion]] debates in the last four years. I recommend that you (and any other new editor) read the [[WP:5P|Five Pillars]], which describes the fundamental principles of Wikipedia. This is an encyclopedia, not an indiscriminate collection of information. Wikipedia content ought to be verifiable, and should consist of summaries of what the range of reliable sources say about a topic. You could spend hours reading all the links on that page, and it would be time well spent for any serious, long-term editor.

:::In order to best meet the goals described in the Five Pillars, we need deletion procedures, to get rid of inappropriate content in a consistent and fair way, while keeping and improving appropriate content. We remove copyright violations immediately when they are discovered, and this is non-negotiable. Our [[WP:NOTABILITY|notability guidelines]], including the [[WP:GNG|General notability guideline]] and a wide range of subject specific guidelines, are essential tools for evaluating articles. Those of us who participate in deletion debates regularly should have good internet research skills, including the ability to sift the wheat from the chaff, and rapidly find solid sources (if available) among all the crap online.

:::I am not a ""deletionist"" and philosophically welcome new content to the encyclopedia, even on what many might consider obscure topics. What is obscure to many readers may be educational, informative and interesting to some readers. If the topic is notable and the information in the article is verifiable, I will recommend keeping the article. Over four years, I have recommended keeping 45.4% of the articles I've evaluated, and deleting 47.6%. The others were mostly recommendations to redirect. So, I tend to be right in the middle.

:::In my experience, editors with reputations as either strong deletionists or strong inclusionists often find that more mainstream editors give little respect to their predictable opinions. I respect editors who take a nuanced view, and explain their recommendations carefully, with consideration for other opinions, and a willingness to change their minds when new facts come to light. That's how I try to conduct myself.

I have read the guidelines around conflict of interest closely and have declared my aim on my User page to work with the Wikipedia community by suggesting changes on the Talk pages of articles about my organisation.

I have recently proposed an update to an article about my organisation on that article's Talk page: see 'Alpha logo updated as of September 2013' on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alpha_course. An editor did initially engage with me about my suggested change but he or she has since gone silent. In an effort to find editors willing to assist me I posted about my suggested change on the Noticeboard of a WikiProject the article is apparently part of: see 'Requesting editor assistance on the Alpha course article' on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Christianity/Noticeboard. Unfortunately no one has responded to me there. Finally I tried asking for assistance on the Wikipedia IRC channel where I was told I was doing the right things and I just needed to be patient.

I would appreciate some advice on how to get editors to review my suggested changes and, hopefully, update the article. I believe my suggested change improves the quality of the article and I have linked to sources that I think verify my claim. Thanks.

I've been very active on Wikipedia (daily editing) for about two months now, before that I sporadically edited. But now that I'm on here so much and see so many pages, I can't count the number of articles I've placed <nowiki>{{refimprove}}</nowiki> on because they have few or no references at all. At this point, it's probably at least 100 articles because I do it daily. This is especially the case with articles about TV episodes or other ""fan topics"" which are often unsourced and border on original research.

So my question is, why, when Editors (including me) see a poorly written article with problems, we put tag on it so it can be improved while if the article has been newly created, it is typically faces a speedy delete? Why do we give 10 year-old articles, that haven't been worked on for years, a chance to improve (even with ""multiple issues"") but if there problems with a new article (which is inevitable with new editors), it's just deleted? I've seen articles with tag that date back to 2009 and, four years later, the article still exists with no improvement at all. 

I think this is what frustrates new article creators because I come across at least a dozen articles every day that would never pass AfC standards. <font face=""Rage Italic"" size=""4"" color=""#800080"">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face=""Times New Roman"" color=""#006400"">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 00:17, 21 September 2013 (UTC)"

First let me say that I would not have volunteered my time to deal with wiki syntax, gather the links/content, and put this page together if I weren't convinced that what I was working on is important/has historical significance/belongs in the encyclopedia. 

I have responded to the deletion message on the talk page, per the instructions, but I also wanted to check in here to ask for advice, as I realize that (as a relative newcomer), I may have inadvertently violated some standard.

My problem is that I wrote and article on James Hancock, the developer of the Mobile Trauma Bay.  However that was rejected.

So rather than started a new article from scratch, I changed the title from JL Hancock to MTB. I then rewrote the text in the same box.

However, there is a credit for an ""Alexander Courage"" as having arranged or created music for on a production of the ""Columbia Workshop"" in 1938.  If this is the same Alexander Courage (born 1919), it would mark one of the earliest jobs that Courage ever had (he would have been 19 years old?), but it would give him additional honor and prestige for having been involved in arranging broadcast music from almost it's earliest inception. SO, DO I update the Columbia Workshop site and create reciprocal hyperlinks -- or is there any additional way to authenticate that this is indeed the same man with whom we associate Star Trek?

I recently created a Wikipedia account because I wanted to create an article for the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, since I am doing some research in the area, and it was listed as a requested article:

[[Requested_articles/Natural_sciences/Physics#Thermodynamics_and_statistical_mechanics]]

When I click on the link for the [[Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis]] , I either get a web page telling me the article does not exist (if I am not logged in), or a web page allowing me to create the article (if I am logged in). Since there was supposedly no such article, I took the liberty of creating one, and submitted it to articles for creation:

[[Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Eigenstate_Thermalization_Hypothesis]]

However, while browsing around on Google, I became aware of this article, which was apparently accepted about two weeks ago:

[[Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis]]

Perhaps there was an issue with the case sensitive nature of the title, which is why I did not see it before?

In any event, my question is how I should approach this situation. With no disrespect to the original author, the article that already exists on the subject seems somewhat vague and not very clearly worded, and certainly contains much less information than mine (it does not appear to contain any mathematical details whatsoever). It appears from the history that it was originally declined several times due to a lack of sources, and I suspect the original author may not have a detailed knowledge of the subject.

I would proceed to just edit the existing article, but to be honest, I find the lack of capitalization of ""thermalization"" and ""hypothesis"" in the title to be somewhat heinous. Is there any way to change the title of an article after it has already been created? It appears that Wikipedia thinks that ""Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis"" and ""Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis"" are two separate articles, with the first one existing, and the second one not existing.

Would it perhaps be easier to just delete the original article if mine is accepted? Or could the original one be merged into mine?

I looked at the edit-page and there seemed to be lots of people involved so I'm not too sure. (Also I've looked at the metacritic page, lots of user reviews that look very fake)

Anyway how do I generally handle things like this?

3845,"574480343","Editing a page where I have conflict of interest","Hi, sorry to be a wiki editing newbie, but I have a question about this page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Tourist_Board

As a representative of London & Partners I'm aware that editing this page could be a conflict of interest (have seen the wiki info on this), so have only updated the current CEO and Chair names as this is just additional factual information. 

Can I add more information about London & Partners? For example a paragraph stating our remit? Or a list of key activities? 

As the tourist board has not existed for a long time, is this page title still correct? London & Partners remit is broader than tourism, should this be a new page and the current page be left as a page about the old organisation? This feels like one page about one old company with the two more recent incarnations as an aside. 

Hope it's ok to ask, would rather get this right!

3846,"574499627","Manual of Style: tense of articles written as chronology","Hi,

I was going to have a go at [Victoria's Secret], as it's in need of copyediting.

Much of it is written in present tense. (""It's 1982. An Encyclopedia is something with dozens of volumes that you look at in the library.""). I can't find anything against that in the [Manual of Style], but the copyediting-required notice complains about it being written in lists rather than paragraphs, so I wondered if that was what was being complained about. 

Is writing about past events in the present tense, even when the date is clear, a MoS breach?

But how can I make sure I am not accused of copyrights infringement by wiki administrators?

I've been reading long enough to know from the talk pages that svg files are preferred when possible, but also that some editors dislike the use of Inkscape, which is all I have.  I am not a graphic artist, but the file in question is small and has poor resolution, and I had an interest in recreating it.  This is the first time I have tried to make any sort of edit to Wikipedia and I don't have a way to convert the file to an Adobe svg format.  

The original file is copyrighted, but I intend to make mine free to anyone who cares to download/modify it etc.  I'm not even very good at Inkscape, so someone with more experience may want to modify my version to make it even more compact/efficient.  I can even export the file to the png versions that normally accompany an svg file, but I have no idea how to create links or any of that.  I don't do html either so I'll need help with all that sort of stuff.  

I have created an account for the express purpose of uploading the file(s) so the four days and ten edits will be a problem.  I only know where the file is in the Wikipedia articles (Warp drive), and I'm not sure if it would be in Wikimedia Commons due to the copyright issue.  The file I hope to replace is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Warptable.gif

Topic area is mind-body practices and philosophies, which are often contested as pseudoscience or as self-promotion and obviously need good solid work to create NPOV that represents without undue weight both sceptics and promotors.
Question is - I get anxious about the primary-secondary source distinction in an emerging and specialist field. A field that has emerged enough to reach notability that is. My thought is the guiding principle is NPOV, independence, reliability, credibility - thus as a field develops peer reviewed and scholarly published journals and gains wider academic engagement, then these sources gain the credibility we're looking for from a secondary source? - but someone commented for example, that wikipedia should not report 'what body psychotherapists say about themselves but what others say about body psychotherapists' which is obviously a good guideline to prevent advertising - except that don't we then also risk getting into a kind of corner where populism is the standard rather than notability and only non-specialists can report on specialist topics therefore reducing reliability and accuracy? thanks for your thoughts  [[User:Depthdiver|Depthdiver]] ([[User talk:Depthdiver|talk]]) 18:36, 16 October 2013 (UTC)"

In August 2013, the Kitt Twins received particularly significant worldwide media attention, with their work being featured on several television channels, including American local stations WGN-TV and WKRC-TV, located in Chicago, Illinois, and Cincinnati, Ohio, respectively, in addition to Spain's nationwide Antena 3, as well as Russia's country-wide stations Channel One and NTV.

However, another editor wiped out the TV channel references. Was that necessary? I provided solid sources, in my opinion (the websites of the TV channels, showing the TV features), and I believe this information is notable. Here are the two Russian features, to better illustrate the situation:

http://www.1tv.ru/news/other/239169

http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/641058

Both the visual and written features are brief, but must they be wiped out? Not every ""non-famous"" musician or band is broadcast in some way all across the Russian Federation, among other places. 

Many thanks in advance for your help and for your time... [[User:Dontreader|Dontreader]] ([[User talk:Dontreader|talk]]) 04:41, 23 October 2013 (UTC)"

4057,"578718100","Question re ""original research""","I know references used in Wikipedia need to be things that are published-- ""available to all""-- and citations show others where they could go to find the source of the material. I've done some research on people in places accessible to everyone, which probably would be considered ""original research"" but for me the line is blurry. I like to tell people there are some very interesting things that are available to anyone. So here is my question: Is it possible to use the words written by an historical person-- to quote directly from a speech or letter-- if the citation says where that speech can be found and it is accessible to all? The citation would look like this, I am thinking (and forgive me if this is somewhere in the instructions for editors... I didn't see this exact thing discussed):

(Imagine a quote from a speech) Concord Free Public Library, ''Franklin Benjamin Sanborn Papers, 1845-1936'', Vault A35, Unit 1, Folder 2, ''Prologue. Spoken at Anti-Slavery Festival, Concord, January 28, 1858''.

I'd like to do more work on that fellow, but the author of a book I used as a reference seemed put-out by my use of her work as a resource, suggesting that if I wanted to write this man's biography for the Wikipedia I should do my own research in the unpublished manuscript she read in a library. I told her that wasn't permitted. And then she said she didn't like people stealing her research. So I backed off the project and she said it could stay as it is but that I should do no more. Not simply stop using her book, but leave the dead man alone. I've since been concerned that others might jump-in and expand this biography and I'd be blamed.

4090,"579498804","Can there be more than one ""English""?","Hi,  One of the pages I'm interested in improving is the ""Full Stop"" page.  The page suffers from a fairly serious problem but I don't know how to deal with it.

Essentially, the words ""Full Stop"" and ""Period"" have different usage in British and American English.  Historically (100 or more years ago) the generic punctuation was usually called a ""period"", and when a period was used to end a sentence it was called a ""full stop"".  This is more or less the modern American English usage, but in British english, full stop became the standard name for the punctuation in any usage.

As it stands now, the article is titled ""Full Stop"".  The usage within the article is mixed but moving towards ""full stop"" instead of period throughout.  From an American English perspective, this is completely incorrect, hence the problem.  But I can't just ""correct"" it to my perspective because then it's wrong for other english speakers.

One approach would simply be majority rules, pick the usage that's more common.  Even that's not clear.  At the moment the article creates the impression that the british usage is more common by listing far more countries where that's used.  But of course many of the other countries are not solely or primarily english speaking.  And it's also not clear if population really matters, or if the number of the Wikipedia readers makes more sense.

Of course ideally we wouldn't choose one or the other.  I could certainly write the beginning of the article in a way that more neutrally describes the discrepancy in usage without favoring either side, but for the rest of the article you have to actually use one word or the other (or attempt some very cumbersome language such as ""this punctuation symbol"" everywhere).  No matter which I choose, I'm imposing the standards of one region on readers from another, essentially making the article prescriptive rather than descriptive.

So is there A. some magical recipe for handling this that I haven't heard about, or B. should I try for very neutral language throughout even though it would make for cumbersome reading, or C. figure out which is more correct for the largest number of readers and use that?

4093,"579521255","Creating an article (redirect)","Hey, Teahouse folks,

I've got a basic question for you. I've been working on categorizing a series of television shows and, for one, the contestants who have been on the show during a few seasons (seasons 2-5) each have article pages. For, I'd say, about 10-15% of them, the pages have developed into full articles as the individuals have gone on to do notable things. But, for the most part, the pages redirect to a section of the season page that lists them and their bio and accomplishments. It's more than just a sentence, since it is a talent program, there is at least a paragraph on each contestant.

So, it looks like some Editor made a project of this but probably has stopped editing. My question is if I'd like to give the same amount of attention to the other contestants, how do I start new articles? The only way I've created a new article is to write it in my Sandbox and then move the page. But in this case, it would be about 20 articles with categories and a redirect. There must be a faster way.

All references to nothing (videos, articles, comments) I have found so far define 'nothing' as non existent, yet It is obvious to me that nothing does exist.
As you may know, the meaning of 'nothing' has not yet been accurately defined, and the subject has been rarely debated over the centuries. English as my third language, and my lack of schooling limits me from presenting a Wikipedia quality article. I do not want credit, only that the truth be known, for it will have a substantial impact on how we view and understand the universe.

If someone would look at my article, and just help me out what to do, and time to time give me suggestions and I will search it out and do all the work.

Like,  can I post articles that say something very different than my understanding of this subject? For instance from a world famous philosopher saying 'nothing doesn't exist', yet I see that he is trying to describe nothing from within nothing, as nonexistence, and not looking at it from the outside. This erroneous view makes his comments nonsensical.
There must be a way, has to be a way to present this article for it effects the definition of many other words, like 'everything' for instance. Or how we understand quantum mechanics/physics and its theory.

So, going back to try and fix my enthusiastic red link vendetta on [[Contact Improvisation]] - have discovered another problem/opportunity :-)  One of my deleted red links restored OK and so now I am thinking I could create a stub and help WP to grow - just that I am nervous, can i just go ahead and do that?? will search for sources first to check notability, but also worried about the overall task  - And the other one, [[Action Theatre]]  is no longer a red link but links to another article which is not the Action Theatre meant in the dance context, so that seems even more daunting.

In teaching myself how to craft an article, using as an object lesson Westinghouse Park in Pittsburgh, I uploaded a picture of a house that was demolished in 1918.  The picture stems, probably, from about 1890.  It has floated around the neighborhood in brochures and newsletters for years.  There is no way for me to figure out who ""owns"" it, if anyone.  

The hideously complicated procedure for uploading images is bad enough, but the morass of licensing information is even more discouraging.  (Why should I participate in something so abstruse?) WikimediaCommons threatens to delete the picture after 8 days if I don't supply a proper ""tag"".  I can't even figure out how to open a ""tag"" or what a tag is in this context.  As far as I'm concerned the picture is in the public domain. So... what should I do?

Even my library system which is usually great, I'm in a major US city, had no good books on the topic. I've found several overview papers that look good but they are all behind pay firewalls and it's not just that I don't want to spend the money, I think there must be good public papers on the topic, for some reason I'm just having a hard time finding them. I always prefer using a paper that is accessible for free when possible so people can directly check the resource if they want.

4182,"581616603","Consensus can change ... (There actually are some reliable sources that the sky is blue.)","I was involved a discussion of a merger proposal [[Talk:Roma (Romani subgroup)#Merger proposal | here]]. I disagree with the consensus reached, and I'd like to propose changing it. However, I want to do this in the least disruptive way possible.

I can see two things I did wrong in the original discussion: 1) since the editor proposing the merger was unwilling to contact people who previously worked on the article, I should have contacted them 2) I should have formally registered my position in the discussion as ""oppose"" rather than just ""comment"".

As far as I can tell, the best way to do this is to start a new discussion on the talk page, and post a notice on the relevant project's [[Wikipedia:Notice board for Romani-related topics | notice board]], which should have happened last time. I'm an inexperienced editor, and I'd like some feedback on how to best go about this.

(Note: I have no personal involvement with this topic, and I'm not mad at anybody.)

I do believe him notable-- his writings are 100 years old and more, and still stand as the best sources of the subject matter. I believe his life to be of greater note than, say, some bimbo from a wealthy family who behaves in an obnoxious-enough manner to get her picture in People Magazine.

Let me tell you in brief, I've been contributing and writing a matter for a page and for some reasons I couldn't spare time to contribute in last few months and few anti-social activists, spammers etc... whose purpose is just to write irrelevants matters, they deleted all the matter which I wrote and started writing issues which has no concern with that person, is it acceptable?

Yesterday, I spent couple of hours to read the whole matter which was written by them and went through all the references which were posted on that page and found all of them were irrelevant and straight forwardly shows someone wants to defame the person who belongs to that page. I found all the edits were unconstructive to Wikipedia, I reverted them to original page content and today again I found someone changed the whole page matter.

Now in this scenario what should I do, does that mean if I contribute my time, energy, efforts in good way and add value to Wikipedia and then someone or few spammers or people who are against of that person would create few accounts on wikipedia and delete all the matter of a page and write whatever they want to write. Let me also tell you as far as references are concerned someone can write a fake blog post and link to it as a reference to defame a famous person, in this case what's the solution?

Please let me know if this is allowed. I think preserving the history of the people who have come before us is so important.

Thank you, Anna Campbell

:Lauren, the format of the {{tl|cite web}} template dictates the layout with the date being parenthesised after the author's name and the retrival date at the end. The only way round this is to format the citation by hand in a layout you prefer. However the format for the citation templates has been developed over a long period by consensus and I suspect that if you hand format you will find that someone will come along and convert them to the citation template format. If you would like to join in the discussion about how the citation templates work the page to visit is [[Help talk:Citation Style 1]].

4328,"584260352","please help me understand","Hello,

I have always wanted to be a part of Wikipedia and especially of its international (English) version, and finally I found some time for that. I am a beginner researcher in the field of IT and location-based solutions/services. These are my main points of interest. So I decided to start my life on Wiki (first, Russian, then English) with these subjects.

Unfortunately, not all contributors/editors perceived my work politely and with understanding. For example, I decided to add an important piece of information to [[Mobile phone tracking]], saying that mobile phones can be positioned not only with the help of GPS, A-GPS and LTE, but also by means of WiFi, WiMax, IP and network environment data based systems. In this regard, I decided to mention the system of AlterGeo because I did not find any other solution (company) that would include positioning based on WiFi, WiMAX, IP addresses, network environment, GSM and LTE in a single, versatile system, and I found multiple articles about that both in English and Russian mass media and blogs.

However, the [[User:88.112.41.6]] removed the company's name from the article saying it was ""spam for small startup"". I tried to explain this was not a spam, and the company is not a small startup, and asked to explain this person's opinion on what exactly I had done wrong. In return, I got rude accusations of working for this company, advertising for them, and so on, which is just not true. My honest answers were not taken into consideration. When I did not get an appropriate, resonable reponse from 88.112.41.6, I said that I would add the info about AlterGeo again and address the wide Wikipedia community of experienced contributors with a question of who is right in this situation if the edit is undone without appropriate explanations again. Meanwhile, [[User:Pinkbeast]] joined 88.112.41.6 to enhance harassments of a newbie that I am - instead of elucidating why exactly I am allegedly wrong.

Moreover, then I finished writing an article about [[AlterGeo]] as a company that from my point of view conformed with all notability and other rules of Wikipedia, and published it while trying to observe all Wikipedia rules. This is my first experience on the English Wikipedia, and I did not have time to have written about anything else. I took this topic to see if I am doing everything right and how Wikipedia really works, all in all. I was not even sure if my Eglish is good enough to publish a brand new article, and I wanted to get a feedback from the others. I had written about AlterGeo on Russian Wikipedia a few months ago, and then I made an article in English. Again, 88.112.41.6 repeated that I am all the more guilty of being allegedly (!) affiliated with this company...

This is ridiculous, from my point of view, when I compare the facts that I know with the words that I read about me.

Dear memebers of the Wikipedia community, could you please make your evaluation of the situation, as well as my and those mentioned users' actions? Is those experienced users' behaviour appropriate, polite, and adequate to the situation? Are my article [[AlterGeo]] and edits to [[Mobile phone tracking]] violating Wikipedia rules? If you tell me I am not right and my edits and article are no good, I will trust you, for sure, and perceive your decision as a professional judgement which will help me improve my data mining, writing and thinking skills.

You can find our correspondence with 88.112.41.6 and Pinkbeast on their talk pages ([[User_talk:88.112.41.6#You_reverted_my_edits_to_Mobile_phone_tracking]] and [[User_talk:Pinkbeast#Your_false_accusation_of_me]]), as well as on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:AlterGeo talk page AlterGeo].

Many thanks in advance. I am not really convinced I am right. I want to hear your opinion, and hope for your kind assistance in gaining an understanding.

P.S. If you think this thread should be created somewhere else, please let me know. I asked those two users about the best place to put it, but they did not reply.

I decided I'm essentially done with it, so I used the ""Move"" button up there and requested that it be moved to the main (Article) space, which worked: it's now  [[James H. Williams, Jr.]]  (I also linked to that from the only mention of him I could find already on en.wikipedia, namely a reference in [[Airframe]].) 

Should I have gone about that a totally different way? The only weird effect I can see is at the top where it says it's a redirect from my User page. Since I never intend to have it back there, and that was (in my mind) just a temporary staging area, could this redirect be deleted? It looks very strange up there--on the other hand, google had already found the first location so perhaps that's why that needs to stay there.

Sorry if I went about the creation process in a sub-optimal way. The next time I want to create an entirely new article, that's on the longer side, what's the best way?

Alexander Montgomerie, 8th Earl of Eglinton (Birth date possibly unknown/uncertain) but

His son was: Alexander Montgomerie, 9th Earl of Eglinton born circa 1660, d. 18 Feb 1728/29.

The references, in the wikipedia entry, to being at the Battle of Marston Moor (which was fought on 2nd of July, 1644) is patently anachronous as the entry claims a birth date of circa 1660.

We'd certainly disclose that on the article's talk page and identify the class source of the edits. Is this OK?

I also know some philosophy and none of the terms they mention in this article are familiar to me. The first two references, the ones that sort of set up the whole article, are IMO not valid refs for a Wikipedia article. The first one is a book that I can't find anywhere, not listed on Amazon, not even in a Google search did it show up and it's marked with ""invalid ISBN"" on the page. The second reference is there but it's just someone's blog. I think this is just a vanity article by some philosophy professor who couldn't get his work published. Is there a tag or tags I can use to express that?  Can I nominate the page for deletion? I see no need to have an article with this name at all and I think it's confusing to people who want to learn about object-oriented analysis and design, ontologies in library science, or  ontology in philosophy.

But there's something strange, for me. The so-called ""debut albums"" are not in the category of his year. I mean, they are in a page by their own, called ""debut albums"" not linked with the main page containing every album released for each year. At least you can find 1 every 10 ""debut album"" also in his year category. Otherwise they are only in the ""debut album"" category by year. I think that if one wants to know which are the debut albums for each year is good to go to a ""debut albums"" category, but if you go to an ""albums by year"" category you should find EVERY album, even if it is a debut album.

Second Question: I placed an image in this article that met ""fair use"", as far as I could see... and this was discussed here. But it appears the image may have been deleted at the source or something, as it's gone from the article. Do I try to load it again, and explain my reasoning (re ""fair use"") in more detail?

I've corresponded with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MatthewVanitas, who encouraged me to reach out to the Teahouse. 

The early successes of Vail were clearly connected to having a quality hospital to treat injured skiers. One of the hospital's first full-time doctors was President Ford's personal physician.

Today, Vail Valley Medical Center treats patients from around the world, including Aksel Lund Svindal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksel_Lund_Svindal). 

Vail is home to the world-renowned Richard Steadman, MD, who treats famous athletes right in the Vail hospital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Steadman). 

Howard Head Sports Medicine is a service of Vail Valley Medical Center and an official medical provider of the US Ski, Snowboard and Free Skiing Teams (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ski_Team). 

As a hospital, we are not at liberty to disclose the names of our patients, but countless articles, blogs, and social media posts credit Vail Valley Medical Center as a hospital that treats well-known professional and amateur athletes.

The hospital will host Kevin Pearce as part of an injury prevention program sponsored by Vail Valley Medical Center: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Pearce_%28snowboarder%29.

These have been:

  1. Serial comma. For example: ""a Prince of Gorodets, Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod"" vs. ""a Prince of Gorodets, Suzdal, and Nizhny Novgorod."" My rule of thumb is to use a comma in a serial comma in a list or 3 or more, or if it improves comprehension. Is there a standard for this?

4436,"586856066","Advice on British English being changed to American English","I created a page about a British children's TV show a while ago. I like to check on it and see how it is doing. Recently the show aired in the US and a user has changed the spelling of the page from British to American English and has modified some terminology to American e.g. wool to yarn, bobsleigh to bobsled etc.

Some character names have also been changed. I know these are not correct for the UK version. I guess these may be correct for the US version of the show however I cannot find a reference to back-up these changes.

I understand wikipedia should be neutral and does not favour one version of a language over another. As this page was first written in British English (and concerns a British show) I think it is okay to undo these changes. Would it be fair and correct to put the US alternative in brackets i.e. wool (yarn) to account for the differences?

I am new to wikipedia and would appreciate some advice on what is best to do.

4460,"587401591","Two Questions-- one re Image Rights and one re the Infobox","1. I've added-to the biography of [[John Hall Wheelock]], which was little more than his birth/death dates and the fact that he was a poet, and I took off the banner saying there needed to be more said about him. I will eventually add some chapters to his life, with more references etc. (I didn't know this man but discovered him while working on ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]'' article.) My idea in regard to articles in general is that they need to invite the reader, and breaking up the text with images is important. A portrait is important on a biography, and I have found a nice one of this man listed on eBay, which was once the property of a newspaper that ran an article on him. Here is my question: If I buy the picture, is it then ""mine"", and can I upload it with all the attributions-- name of photographer, when and where it was published originally, etc.? If it is ""mine"", should I upload to the Commons? I realize it wouldn't be ""mine"" in the sense that I created it, but perhaps ""mine"" to share.

2. I've seen some discussion re the use of the Infobox. It seems some editors don't like them and want a picture without all the description. I've liked them, as I can get an immediate sense of who the person is-- although visually it seems ""cleaner"" when the picture is without all the words. My ""vote"" would be that the ""lesser-known"" individuals be given an Infobox, and those who are ""household names"" don't need one (i.e. we know what Christopher Columbus did-- and you couldn't fit all the genocide and other controversies into an Infobox anyway). So... if I can purchase and upload a picture of Mr. Wheelock, I will give him an Infobox. They can be tedious to create... so if it seems they aren't desired and some bot will come along eventually and eat them, I could skip doing this.

I am entirely clueless as to what to do next. I went where the message suggests, and nothing seems to fit. Perhaps I've had too much Holiday Eggnog, but I am also an older person who can write (and actually read cursive, which I have learned is an impossible feat for those who spell ""you"" with one letter), but I am rather lame when it comes to knowing what it is that ImageTaggingBot is talking about. 

I like the look of the article with some human faces on it (they are saying ""carpe diem"" as in ""Dead Poets Society"") and don't want them to be deleted simply because I don't know how to get across the fact that I have permission to put them there.

I've been trying to add useful material to the article on Allan Rae (Alberta composer).  I'm not sure about a number of items and have asked questions at the pages talk page.  If any experienced editor might be interested, I would appreciate any advice and suggestions.  

I've added works lists and tried to improve the biography, though I really think it needs to be rewritten.  The sources I have include an online encyclopedia, Baker's dictionary of musicians and various other documents.    

The information about his works comes from his webpage (which is now gone!) and from a resume he forwarded to me.  How should this be cited?  However, a version of his webpage can be found at the Wayback Machine.  Ought I to link to that?  I've also linked to a couple of articles and a Youtube video of one of his compositions.  Is this okay? 

Any advice appreciated.

I can see the case for merging them but also I can see a strong case for keeping them separate. But Softzen did the merge with no merge proposal, without saying anything before hand on the Talk page of either article, etc. What is more the changes he made with the merge IMO really disrupt the flow of the article [[Object-oriented analysis and design]]  The merged text more or less says the same thing (general discussion about benefits of OO, why we do analysis, etc.) So the  [[Object-oriented analysis and design]] article which IMO was reading fairly well seems confusing now. But mostly I object to someone doing a merge like this without discussing it first. I left a message on [[User_talk:Softzen]] after I reverted his merge the first time explaining how merges are supposed to be done. He thanked me for that and said he would create a merge proposal and then he went ahead and redid the merge again.

As a Canadian, I find it weird to write on ""Canada"" before it existed. On the one hand, this is a geo-nerd kind of technicality: obviously the elements that eventually became Canada existed in 1750, 1803, etc, so it's perfectly fine to write under the overall dates heading. So, I'm NOT proposing changing the overall heading (""1750 in Canada""). But it might be helpful to put an italicized note sub-head for each ""in Canada"" page prior to 1867 that says something such as ""Canada didn't come into existence until Confederation in 1867; the events and people discussed below lived in territories that eventually came under the umbrella of Canada."" Or some more felicitous heading.
So: a) is it OK to make such a sweeping addition -- to probably a couple hundred pages b) is there any fast way to bulk-add such a change or does it go page by page? c) and wordsmiths come up with a catchy way of saying this?

Here is a very basic question.   When text appears in blue with a dotted (pecked) line underneath, what does this mean, and more to the point what can I do about it -- i.e. how to get rid of it.  If I have already identified a word or phrase at its first use in blue so as to direct a reader to its wikipage, I don't necessarily want to direct the reader again at every repeat use of the word or phrase.   Also, some of the items are so obvious to a person reading the type of article that it does not seem very appropriate to put them in blue.   Hope my question makes sense.

Is a newcomer to the tearoom allowed two questions on the same day/visit ?

If so, when I want to refer to the same reference (source) a second or third time in article, how best to do this.  ""Opcit"" seems the obvious method, but I am conscious that as articles are edited the work cited immediately above may become a long way from the subsequent reference if new material and new references are inserted in between.  

I expect I could find the answers if I studied the instructions more thoroughly, but as you have invited questions....      Hope I'm not wasting your precious time.

::Hello {{U|KhalidCalgary}}, and welcome to the Teahouse. Here are examples of promotional language: You wrote that the group has a ""dedicated team"". Do you mean to imply that other such groups have less dedicated teams? How can you prove how dedicated they are? Is there an objective measure of dedication that this team has passed? What is the evidence for that? You write that the group ""offers both depth and volume in terms of programming and experience to facilitate the successful introduction and integration"". How deep? What volume? Who says so, other than the group itself? That whole phrase is marketing speak and management jargon that is simply not appropriate for a [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] encyclopedia article.

:::'''Cullen328:''' While I agree that KhalidCalgary needs a source for the phrase ""dedicated team"" I suspect (because it is a computer programming team) it was used in the same [[IT]] context as ""[[dedicated server]]"". That is to say a server (or team) whose ''assigned'' function is 100% focused on a single specific task/project as opposed to being a general resource shared among a number of different projects. Outside of the IT world such a team might be called a ""targeted team"" or even just a ""taskforce"". This phrase is less a case of promotion and more an issue with [[WP:JARGON|JARGON]].

When I enter the name of the article in the Wiki Search box, I would expect the name to appear in the list of search results as I type - however, nothing similar appears. If I enter the name in lower case, I am taken to a page which states that the article ""sota mapping project"" does not exist, would I like to create it? If I enter the name exactly as ""SOTA Mapping Project"", I am taken to another page which states that an article exists on the Wiki with that name.

If I do a search on Google, the Wiki article appears on the first page of Google search results.

So, what am I missing here? Does it always take a while before an article appears in the Wiki Search results? Is the article waiting to be approved by some editor somewhere? Did I forget to include something in the article code?

Hope somebody can shed some light on this,

I have a question about resolving a dispute. I made a good faith edit to [[Shogi]] that I felt was an improvement. However, another more experienced user ""undid"" my edit and because he felt it actually  made the page worse. That's fine. The person left a message on my talk page telling me what they did and that they would be willing discuss things point by point if I wanted. That's fine too. I thanked them, said I wouldn't undo their undo (though I apparently worded that poorly), suggested we work together to improve the section, and suggested that we could discuss it on my talk page, but that the Shogi talk page would probably me more appropriate. The response I got implied that because of my writing style, such a discussion on Shogi talk would likely be lengthy and possibly boring to others so my talk page was a better place to do it. That seemed like a red flag to me, but I am new to Wikipedia so I am not sure of the proper protocol. So we started discussing ""my mistakes"", ""my poor writing style"", ""my poor edits"", etc. and were getting nowhere. I again suggested trying to get others involved, possibly by moving to the Shogi talk page, but have been pretty much told ""no."" I've tried to keep my tone as positive as possible throughout, but I feel (wrongly perhaps) that this person is more interested in lecturing than discussing. I thought Wikipedia was about being a part of a community and trying to get as many people involved as possible so that a consensus can be reached, but it seems that I am apparently wrong.

But because this process is taking so long, I think it would best if someone with more experience look at it and explain in more detail what I need to have this article approved.

She is a new teacher, but there are a lot of interviews and world-wide acceptance of her teaching. Please advise. I welcome any and all constructive criticism.

Thank You

4612,"589973518","Due Dilligence","I just started doing some editing on the article [[CORBA]]. One of the issues is that there aren't many references. I have a book that is one of the standard goto books for IT people on the topic and also since CORBA is an open standard there is great documentation on the site of the OMG standards group. So getting the refs is no problem. My question is the following: as I read through the article it seems reasonable, not great writing but not terrible and to the extent I remember this stuff it all sounds good. But I haven't done a lot of hands on CORBA work so I'm not positive that what is there is totally accurate. I realize the best thing to do would be to read carefully, consult my books, etc. but if I'm not up to that right now would it be an improvement to just add the refs even if I'm not 100% sure that the text matches them? Or would that essentially be perhaps making things worse since I'm giving good references to potentially bad info? I feel 100% confident that my refs are some of the best refs for CORBA so I think I would be improving the article, and there is nothing on the Talk page that indicates people are challenging what is there in a major way.

4629,"590172180","How to 'implement' a redirect","A personal research project on place names in the United Kingdom led me to the page ""List of places in County Durham"".

The last name in the list is ""Wreckenton"", which, until I just made a few edits, pointed at no other Wikipedia article, unlike most of the other entries in this list.  The edits that I have already implemented make a minor edit to the article on ""Wrekenton"", which makes a note of the fact that ""Wreckenton"" is a late 19th century spelling for today's ""Wrekenton"".  I have made this edit based on information, found elsewhere on the web, that transcribes entries from the Comprehensive Gazetteer of England and Wales, 1894-5, which I have duly correctly referenced.  I have therefore put the correct internal link in the list.

OK so far, that gives you a summary of what I have done and the context of my question.

What I do not know how to do is to implement the link so that it does not just simply go the ""Wrekenton"" page {that is what I've done} but rather goes to the ""Wrekenton"" page and displays on that resultant page ""(Redirected from Wreckenton)"", cf. ""West Pelton"" from the same list of places, which causes the page on ""Pelton"" to be displayed with the reference "" (Redirected from West Pelton)"" being displayed immediately under the line that reads ""From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"".

I am just at the beginning of a massive research on British Heritage and am hoping to be able to become a significant contributor and editor over time.  Up until now I have only done a few grammar and internal link edits.

With thanks in anticipation for some useful advice.

question: where can one put this type of talk? i very, very much hesitate to put a section on the talk page on the individual page to write up the problems, concerns, possible solutions, ...   i am concerned that this will not be considered proper talk (not sufficiently mathematical), deleted immediately and i will be chastised. 

specific example. on [[sine]] page there is used a lovely template [[template:function]]. the code in the template itself is a bit hard to read as it is a single paragraph (not source formatting) and also templates are notoriously difficult to translate  since they contain code and links and ... so the problem is dual.  there is the techno difficulties of translating the template itself and there are the problems of using the template on the math page, which e.g. here might be the naming and linking to the page on the ""period of a function"" (as opposed to say ""periodic functions"", ""periodicity"" - currently the link in the template links to a redirected page....) 

these difficulties in different forms come up on every page. any suggestions? it would be lovely (but i know totally impractical) to have ""trans-talk page on each article do as not to bother the ""talk"" pages. thank-you. 05:48, 16 January 2014 (UTC)"

I enjoy reading about mathematics on Wikipedia, (I have no real math background myself) but find that some articles are very good in teaching me how to ""speak aloud"" the math notation [[Well-founded_set]] is a decent example of one of these, IMHO, and conversely [[Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic]] fails to do this.  I find it MUCH easier to understand the pages when this kind of beginners help is provided.  Although some pages are tagged as ""too technical"", that doesn't really give enough of a hint for the authors to improve.

I was thinking of starting to create both a template and an advice page, and start tagging pages as ""Needs more explanation of how to speak this notation"".  Is this something that would need to be taken to the ""Policy"" section of Wikipedia, or can I just forge ahead without stepping on toes?

I also know that edits to the sandbox should be marked with ""sandbox"" or some variant ([[Wikipedia:Edit summary legend#Sandbox]]) so Wikipedians looking at recent changes know they can ignore this and focus on other things (trolls or newbie mistakes, I'm guessing).

Does this apply to my userpage or its subpages? If so, what should I put?

Also, I edit a lot in the template namespace and was wondering if they show up at all? Most revisions of mine are extremely trivial tweaks to code subpages (e.g., Template:Buzzword/testcases). If I don't need to specify what I changed code-wise, should I write something like ""template editing""? I don't want to be a nuisance and cloud the Recent Changes thing, which I'm not too familiar with.

I had in mind to edit an article on ""Southern Cross, Yilgarn"" which states that the streets of the Western Australian town are named after stars.

Thank you for inviting me to this forum, I appreciate it greatly.

I've been working on my first page on a significant UK poet.  My page was declined for the second time (the first time it was a layout point which I rectified) because I haven't referenced all the awards/prizes (this I am willing to do) but more importantly, and why I am writing to you, I have been asked to condense the publication and award/prizelist to the top three in each.  This doesn't make any sense as a writer's history is found in their publications and the awards shows the public acknowledgements and achievements.  I have written to my editor expressing my concern but he hasn't replied, and I don't think he will as he has a post on his page saying that he doesn't get into discussion on why he has declined an article.  I have also checked many other pages of contemporary poets of similar standing and none of them have a condensed list of publications or awards.  I am really at a loss as to what to do as I feel to put this page up with a condensed list is a slap in the face to a poet and yet, the alternative is no page at all.

:{{tping|Dan anj}} Hey Dan. Welcome. So I went through the article and I've fixed a few issues. The reference template parameter <code>|first=</code> which you were using is for an author's first name (and is paired with <code>|last=</code>). You wouldn't normally use it as you were. When you cite to a website like Allmusic, you should indicate that with the <code>|publisher=</code> parameter (which I've done for all). I've also combined one reference you cited twice. See [[Help:Referencing for beginners#Same reference used more than once]].<p>The bigger issue is that most of citations are to Discogs, which is a site with [[WP:USERG|user-generated]] content, ""a community-built database"" and therefore there is no way to [[WP:V|verify]] that its entries are correct. What I suggest is that you start building the article up with sources from more [[WP:IRS|reliable sources]], which you might find through a search like [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Tim+Presley%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#q=%22Tim+Presley%22&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&tbm=bks Google Books]. Unfortunately, Google News (archive) used to be a very valuable resources to find newspaper articles, but it's almost useless now and will be for at least a few more months while the supposed rebuilding of it takes place. Anyway, try to find more reliable sources to work from like (non-vanity published) books, newspaper articles and magazine write ups.

I have a question about using [[Template:Refimprove|Refimprove]]. I am working on improving [[Kanji kentei]]. The article was marked with an ''additional citations needed for verification''&nbsp; template in June 2008. Even though it has been almost 6 years, the article is still lacking sufficient citations. So, I am wondering if I can do the following:
# Change the date in the template to February 2008; or
# Add an [[Template:Expand Japanese|''Expand Japanese'']] template to the article.<p>

I am not sure about #1 simply because leaving the date as is indicates how long this has been a problem. On there other hand, if there is some kind of date-related indexing involved with pages such as these, then a  page tagged 6 years ago might have been long since archived.<p>

To me, #2 seems harmless, especially since there exists quite a number of Japanese sources related to this test and good English sources may difficult to find. However, I've never added this kind of template before so not sure of the ramifications, if there are any.<p>

This page was recently rejected for the following reason: 'Still not seeing a significant claim for Filmmaker notability, which is the best claim being made.'

The British Film Institute link at the article's conclusion lists over 40 films he produced and/or directed, included ones that have won awards and the first film shown on the UK's Channel 4 - Walter - starring Ian McKellen and directed by Stephen Frears. 

If more sources are required I have a few scanned articles that can be linked to in the references (although I need advice on how to access an embedded list). However, I would value independent advice on the reason for rejection and the best course of action from here.

4938,"595600486","Desirability of Pictures","Hi,
  I'm working on a page that is about a living artist (Painter).  It is my intent to use multiple pictures of her art.  But when I browse other artists' pages, I couldn't help but notice they a large number of the ones I saw had no samples of the artists work but all other topics are well illustrated.
  Does Wikipedia discourage the use of pictures of artists' work or is this just a coincidence and perhaps the authors of those pages weren't able to get free-use images?
  It is my view that, though the various accomplishments of the artist, such as exhibitions, awards and teaching experience, are important, it really their work that identifies them.
  Thanks for giving consideration to my question,
    Murray

I have recently been editing a page on Jerry Bresler and thought it would be nice to add a photo of him.  I searched the Internet and found a nice one on the Corbis website.  The image is one of the thumbnails they use to show an example of the full-sized image (dated 1955).  I sent an email to them asking if the image could be used on Wikipedia.  Not surprisingly, I didn't get an answer

   The Corbis website offered the following information under the title ""Restrictions"" which I was unable to decipher as to what it meant: 
    ""This is a publicly distributed film, television or publicity photograph. Non-editorial use may require additional clearances.""

   Setting that meaning aside, I thought about the possibility that it might fall under the category of images of deceased people. 

   Here is the URL to the image:  http://www.corbisimages.com/Search#q=jerry+bresler

If you should go to the website, click on the small thumbnail and a window with a larger image and more info on the picture will open.

:Gomez, welcome to the Teahouse.  These cite errors sometimes aren't the easiest things to define or explain but tryng as best I can you've got a ref that you've named Chris1, the only problem was that you used the template ({{tl|reflist}}) in the article before the point at which you defined Chris1, so when the software was tryng to work out what to display it was getting confused because ''reflist'' was trying to explain a reference that it had no data for.  Removing the first use of reflist - it wasn't need there anyway - and the problem goes away. See this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AGomez050%2Fsandbox&diff=595889800&oldid=595888167 diff].

I have made a good start on a major list of all radio broadcast transmission characteristics from commencement c.1920 to date (callsigns, frequencies, etc):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australian_radio_broadcast_transmission_characteristics
But I have 600 sections (one for each radio station) and the table of contents at the start is very very long. I have seen articles with long tables of contents placed side by side with the article on the right hand side. How do I do this?
